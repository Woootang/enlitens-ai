{I have adhd and anxiety , depression and im struggling to find a therapist that would be a good fit. I am a mom of two neurodivergent kids as well}
{Im coming to therapy after years of coping with my suspected AuDHD through unhealthy means. Namely, I’ve found myself taking on massive mutual aid / organizing projects as a means of asserting some sort of control over a world that feels increasingly beyond my control. Recently, I got some feedback from a Black man I was friends with and had been organizing with about some racist harm I’d caused him (making promises I couldn’t keep, stealing from him, talking about him negatively behind his back, and playing a victim). As I received this feedback, I realized that I was having some pretty extreme neurocognitive issues around routine rigidity, impulsivity, not remembering things, and using him to emotionally regulate without consent. Looking back on my life, I’ve realized this isn’t the first time I’ve done something like this, and through conversations with my closest friends (almost all of whom are AuDHD), I’ve decided I’d like to explore that diagnosis / how my own neurodivergent brain works. I want to do this work both to improve my neurocognition and take accountability for the harm I caused. 
I have some questions for you I'd like to write down so we're looking at the same thing :)  (1) I'm curious to hear about what if any experience you have working with folks with chronic health conditions and people still taking COVID precautions. (2) Do you have experience working with mutual aid organizers or an understanding of mutual aid? (3) I'd also like to know what if any experience you have with accountability processes. More specifically, how have you worked with clients when their own unhealthy coping strategies cause harm to others to take accountability for the harm they caused?}

I am looking for a new counselor for my son. He is 12 years old and in 6th grade. He has been in therapy for over 2 years and it has been a great help, and led us to get him a diagnosis of autism. He has a high verbal IQ and low processing speed. He also has a written expression disability that we recently added to his IEP. In the past this lead to a lot of frustration and behavioral problems in school. This has improved with learning to express his feelings. School has started recently and he is struggling a bit with the homework. We visited the children's autism center this week to start trying a medication for focus for his ADHD. It would be great to have a counselor in place too, especially someone with availability outside of school hours.}

Hi Liz, my name is Allison Hull. I am a 41 year old woman, and I struggle with anxiety and depression, but mostly I struggle with ADHD. Lately, I am constantly overwhelmed and feel like I am falling behind, regardless of whether I am making "progress" at all. Also, I have been struggling more and more with intrusive thoughts, often related to the state of the world (surprise!). I feel like I am drowning, and I need help figuring out how to live my life in a more functional, present, and confident way. I prefer to be contacted by text or email. My insurance is out of network, however I am not concerned with the cost. My schedule is flexible and I am okay with virtual or in person visits. I am not sure if you work with adults, but if so please let me know if you are taking new patients. Thank you for your time!

{My 18 yr old daughter is looking for a therapist that has a good understanding of her needs. We believe you may be a good fit. She has had extensive therapy, such as CBT, DBT, Residential ERP at Rogers in Wisconsin for OCD, medication and currently TMS for depression, over the years. Ava has a diagnosis of GAD, Depression, OCD, ADHD and Autism. She was only recently diagnosed with Autism within the last year or so. From my perspective her Autism and ADHD create an internal daily struggle. Almost as if she has two different people driving "the bus". I believe she is unable to move forward in her adult life because she has trauma from living highly "masked" in early childhood through middle school. She needs to work towards acceptance of who she is as a person so she can grow in her confidence and be proud of her talents. If you think you may be able to help, please let me know. You can contact Ava directly at. If you are unable to reach her my number is. Thanks! Michelle Mayo}

Hi Liz, I’m a late-diagnosed ADHD woman seeking a better therapeutic fit after working with one therapist and three psychiatrists here in St. Louis. I took a break from therapy once my medication stabilized, but I’m now at a point where I need support again—particularly with family dynamics and emotional regulation. We’ve started the UMSL assessment process for our 6-year-old son and are awaiting results. I also suspect our 3-year-old may be on a similar neurodivergent path. I’m especially interested in family counseling that considers the possibility that my husband may be the only neurotypical in the household. I saw that you offer clarity assessments and support around AuDHD—this really resonated with me. While I only have an ADHD diagnosis, I relate strongly to autistic traits and would appreciate the opportunity to explore that further with someone experienced in neurodivergent adult women. I work full time in a demanding role, but I can make time for a consultation. Text or email is the best way to reach me, as I’ll need to step into a private room to take calls. Thanks so much—I’m looking forward to connecting. Warmly,

Hi, I’m the mom of a 7 year-old with autism and recently recognizing my own autism and adhd traits. I would like adhd testing for my son and family or individual counseling.

Please let me know what the next steps are. Thank you!|}

Hi Liz, My name is Ray Robson, I'm a 30 year old male. Recently late diagnosed with ASD (most likely Asperger's under old criteria), with some ADHD traits. I've never been to therapy before, so I'm not sure how the start of the process works. I'm happy to do an initial consult if that's the normal procedure, but I wouldn't mind jumping straight in either. I will notice texts fastest but email should also be reliable to reach me. I have had some interpersonal relationship events that I'd like to discuss with a therapist, and I'd also like help strategizing ways to increase my productiveness in completing mundane tasks and sustaining overall motivation levels. I am pretty free most days, but usually wake up very late.

Hello, I’m interested in helping my husband, Lou. For over a year we worked with a couples therapist after discovering he is AuAdhd. After talking with her she recommended to reach out to you because it seems maybe he needs to work with someone focusing on himself to understand the impacts of neurodivergence and learn tools to deal with his challenges that impact our relationship. He states he’s open to this and also continues to forget to reach out to you. I am trying to support him without taking on the responsibility of “translating or parenting” him in the help he needs. I’d like to help him schedule an initial consult to see if this is a good fit.}

Hi wondering if you have availability for new clients this month and if your office accepts United (employer coverage). Looking for in-person therapy for a combo of anxiety/burnout (long term), compulsive eating (recent) and probably some undiagnosed Neuro differences. (Not seeking medical diagnoses at this time). I am generally available evenings and weekends but also work remotely on wednesday/friday and can probably make some daytime availability work on those days too depending on the time. Phone calls are okay to contact but a short text so I can program number as "not spam" will speed up my response time.}

{Good evening, Liz, This is Jane, Kate's mom. I have left several messages asking that you call to set up an appointment for Kate.

{Hi Liz, My partner and I are looking for a neurodivergent specialist couples therapist. We've been together 5 years and deeply care about one another but we have nonstop communication indifferences and we would like to better our communication and commitment to one another. I was diagnosed with ADHD and my therapist has stated she thinks I have autism and I tend to agree. I did all of the tests and scored pretty high. Id like to formally get diagnosed but not sure how to start the process so in the mean time I'm trying to embrace who I am and love that instead of shame myself. My partner, Jonathan, is neurotypical and wants to better our relationship through our struggles with the ND/NT difference. We'd really like to do in person and Saturdays would be best for us. I have UHC, he has Aetna. We aren't too sure how insurance works but would love to talk more about this all. Thank you!}

Hello! I'm kind of old hat to the therapy thing, but it has only ever kinda worked. I was diagnosed AuDHD at 38 [ 2 years ago now] and it makes more sense why traditional therapy hasn't completely met the mark for me. I'm going to cut myself off, because i could ramble on and explain everything but that's not appropriate for this box. I just know i need someone to help me talk and brainstorm and finagle some answers or solutions out of all the details in my head. I'm better with email than phone, if you wish to get ahold of me [ phone conversations are just difficult]. Im available Monday mornings, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays. Please let me know if perhaps you might be available to work with me [ your office space photos give me such happy vibes].}

Hello, I actually called your office and left a message but wanted to send an email and didn’t know for sure what your email was. My daughter, Lindsey, is needing some help. She is struggling with her executive function. She is actually struggling with some life stuff too. She is failing college. She’s also not sure what she wants to do with her life (career). I think she’s lost. She’s only had this diagnosis for a few years. She has so many great qualities. She’s just getting lost with all the things she’s struggling with. She has depression and it seems to be getting a little worse recently. And she also struggles with her weight from binge eating. I did read your information on your website and it look like you possibly might be able to help her get her life in order and help her figure out how her brain works and utilize her strengths. I just hate seeing her like this. I appreciate your time and consideration. Lesley.}

I've left a voicemail previously for your office but chickened out calling back. Thought I'd try email. Reach me text, call or email.}

{Good morning, My daughter is 17, recently she was diagnosed with autism, adhd, and depression. She has been struggling in school the last year, missed about 2-3 days a week, so we had her evaluated as what could be going on. She also is doing virtual homeschool this year, in hopes that this will be better for her. She was the one that spoke up and asked us to have her evaluated, we both agreed that after we understood what was going on, she would find a therapist to help her through this time. After reading your bio you seem perfect for her. (She agreed) if possible we would like to set up a session, if you are currently taking on new clients. Thank you,}

{Hello Elizabeth, I am a therapist over at LifeStance and am prepping to leave the company by the end of the year (secret info!) I have a 23 y/o client with Autism who has been through it with providers and I want to make sure she finds a GREAT fit. She is passionate about doing self-esteem work, so your bio caught my eye. What is your caseload looking like these days - how long is your waitlist?

Hi there! I'm seeking to return to therapy as my anxiety has progressed over the past 6 months after some detrimental work experiences. I've been struggling with some major imposter's syndrome and generalized anxiety towards my relationships, and it's something I'm beginning to realize I need help with. I also have raging ADHD and feel like that's been roadblocking my life, and I've never had the tools to combat it. I work a general 9-5 job, so online options would be preferable - especially ones in the evening or weekend. I'd love to chat about an initial consultation, and feel free to email me if we could do that! Thanks so much :)}

{I am looking for an initial consult with an autism and LGBTQ-friendly counselor. My official autism assessment isn't until January, but I'm experiencing some issues that appear to be autism-related that I would like help with, such as: hyperfixations, social anxiety, being overwhelmed by stimuli and basic tasks, dermatillomania, procrastination, and possible autistic burnout. I was also previously diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type II, ADHD, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder. I’m currently in counseling and being treated by a psychiatrist, but autism isn’t their specialty. My number is 636-577-4313, and I am available pretty much any time by text, email, and phone. Thank you for your time!}

{Hi! I am a therapist in STL and I have a couple of referrals that I thought you might be a good fit for. I have seen your responses from the FB STL Therapist group. I wanted to make sure you have openings before I send them your way? I primarily see LGBTQ+ women that use insurance or pay around 100$ a session. The clients are usually neurodivergent and wanting to work on emotions, trauma, self esteem, etc. Does that sound like a good fit for you? Thank you so much!}

{Elizabeth, I'm reaching out on behalf of my husband, Kevin, who is looking for a counselor. I found you because I was searching for someone who takes United Health Care insurance and works with people who are neurodivergent. Long story short, my husband is very smart and talented in his field- he also consistently struggles with relationships at work, workaholic/obsessive tendencies and has been let go for some jobs in the past 5 years. Kevin has never been diagnosed, but both of us believe he has ADHD. Kevin is asking me to initiate this process because I am an LCSW and he feels I can help select someone who might fit his needs. Would you be willing to consult with me/him/us? Thank you for your time. Dannie Hodges}

My wife and I are interested in doing couples therapy with a therapist who specializes in helping the neurodiverse. I have OCD and potentially have autism, and she is neurotypical but navigating a chronic illness. We want to work on our communication skills as a couple and already see therapists individually. We are also part of the LGBTQ community and are looking for someone who can be supportive of that. Please let me know if you have any availability to do an initial consult. Phone/text is the best way to reach me, but email is fine too.}

{Hi there! My name is Marlena Milshteyn. I’m 22 years old, and I was reaching out to inquire about a new patient consultation. I have ADHD and Autism (late diagnosis club at 19 years old), as well as CPTSD. I was looking through your page and I feel like you are very much the type of practitioner I have been wanting to work with. I’ve been in therapy since I was a child and have had a complicated relationship with therapy over the past few years, but I really appreciate how you described your therapeutic approach. Also, the squishmallows and office vibes were both MASSIVE pluses, haha! Being highly therapized, I feel like I am a little *too* self aware, and need more help with managing daily functioning, working on strengthening my frustration threshold/managing big emotions, and improving on some internal insecurities that are present from past traumas and unmasking my autism and adhd. If you’re available, I would love to set up a consultation to see if we are a good fit! You can reach me by email or}

{Hello! I had a therapist when I was away at school and now need one I can meet with in-person. In November I was informally (by my therapist) diagnosed with autism so I have been navigating that with varying levels of difficulty. I’m also about to get married, move, and start my first year of teaching. And ya girl isn’t great at coping with change! I’ve also just got a ton of discovery and understanding to do after being misdiagnosed with an anxiety disorder in high school and having my whole life based around that misdiagnosis.}


{Hey there, My name is Freya, I recently moved across the river to St. Louis and am looking to get back into therapy. I’ve had many life changes recently and find my anxiety getting the best of me, and want to get back to a place of enjoy life again, progressing and bettering myself, not just surviving each day. I’m seeking rather intense therapy that challenges me to get outside of myself and comfort zone. I have United Health insurance and believe you’re in my network, but would like to check in on that, and get your rates as well. I’d be available for therapy after 4pm as I work from home until 3:30pm. You can call, text or email whenever works for you. If I do not answer your call I will return one if you leave a voicemail. Thank you in advance!}


{Hello Elizabeth Wooten, I recently realized I've experienced a higher number of adhd symptoms than I thought. I've related heavily to those I know who have been medically diagnosed with adhd also. I was looking to see if I might have adhd, especially with the chance my parents could have missed it. I would also love for someone who is LGBTQIA+ allied, to help me with some of the more difficult parts I have recently struggled with in my life. Sincerely, Lillian}
