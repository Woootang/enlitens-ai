Nigg\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Oregon Health &amp; Science University\n\nPsychopathology emerges from the dynamic interplay of physiological and mental processes and ecological context. It can be seen as a failure of recursive, homeostatic processes to achieve adaptive reequilibrium. This general statement can be actualized with consideration of polygenic liability, early exposures, and multiunit (multi-' level ' ) analysis of the psychological action and the associated physiological and neural operations, all in the context of the developmental exposome. This article begins by identifying key principles and clarifying key terms necessary to mental disorder theory. It then ventures a sketch of a model that highlights epigenetic dynamics and proposes a common pathways hypothesis toward psychopathology. An epigenetic perspective elevates the importance of developmental context and adaptive systems, particularly in early life, while opening the door to new mechanistic discovery. The key proposal is that a /uniFB01 nite number of homeostatic biological and psychological mechanisms are shared across most risky environments (and possibly many genetic liabilities) for psychopathology. Perturbation of these mediating mechanisms leads to development of psychopathology. A focus on dynamic changes in these homeostatic mechanisms across multiple units of analysis and time points can render the problem of explaining psychopathology tractable. Key questions include the mapping of recursive processes over time, at adequate density, as mental disorders unfold across development.\n\n## General Scientific Summary\n\nMental disorders develop in the midst of complex processes.

Email: niggj@ohsu.edu developing children, adolescents, and young adults (Homberg et al., 2016; Kessler et al., 2005). In turn, the dynamic, asynchronous process of human development is exquisitely sensitive to ecological context. Thus, like development itself, although some elements are static/stable, the entire syndrome is not; psychopathology emerges from dynamic cybernetic and transactional processes (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Ceci, 1994; Cicchetti, 1984, 2016; Cicchetti &amp; Natsuaki, 2014; Cicchetti &amp; Toth, 2009; Hyman, 2018; Kendler, 2008; Miller, 1996; Thomas &amp; Sharp, 2019).\n\nPart 1 sets the stage. The /uniFB01 rst subsection, The Phenomena, provides a crucial context not only for this but for any theory in psychopathology, addressing the realities that characterize the phenomena of interest: its complexity, development-in-context, genotype-environment interplay, the importance of the exposome, and the nonignorable element of individual construal of experience. My intent is to orient the reader to the conceptual layers necessary to any theory of psychopathology. In the second subsection, Conceptual Clari /uniFB01 cations, I de /uniFB01 ne key multivalent concepts for present purposes. The third and /uniFB01 nal subsection of Part 1, Etiology and Epigenetics, provides context for the epigenetics element.\n\nPart 2 provides a theoretical sketch or schema of an epigeneticcentered model, then introduces and explains a multilevel, common pathways hypothesis that can render the complexity of the problem tractable. 1 I include example hypotheses and highlight epigenetic process, self-regulation, and the importance of integrating different units of analysis. 2\n\n## Part 1: Setting the Conceptual Context\n\n## The Phenomena\n\nThe problem is compelling: Mental health disorders, addiction, and neurodevelopmental conditions collectively constitute the largest single source of health burden in the world in terms of years lived with disability (Whiteford et al., 2013). Any theory of mental disorder must account for the multiple known features of the phenomenon: complexity, development, environmental/social context, and self-regulating mental evaluations of experience.\n\n## Complexity\n\nFirst, the conditions described in the DSM are not discrete diseases with discrete causes but are partially related, both phenotypically and biologically (Anttila et al., 2018; Borsboom et al., 2011; Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2019; de Jonge et al., 2018; Kotov et al., 2017; Plana-Ripoll et al., 2019; Radonji /C19 c et al., 2021). At least for descriptive purposes, they may be organized hierarchically (Achenbach, 2020; Kotov et al., 2017; Kotov et al., 2021), or alternatively, in a small-world network perspective (Borsboom et al., 2011). However, beyond stipulating the phenotypic and biological relatedness of the many conditions, my argument does not depend on a particular nosological architecture.\n\nYet, second, heterogeneity is also the rule. Even within putative disorders, etiological and phenotypic variability require characterization, to maximize mechanism discovery and clinical value. Indeed, as required by polygenic theory (Wray et al., 2018), even speci /uniFB01 c genetic etiology is heterogeneous, despite the partial genetic overlaps among conditions. Likewise, the clinical phenomena are protean: for any syndrome or dimension, features and expression can vary noticeably by age or social or incentive context.\n\nThird, much psychopathology is on a continuum with normal function (Burns et al., 2019; Haslam et al., 2012; Hyman, 2010; Shankman et al., 2009; Waszczuk et al., 2020). However, properly describing its dimensional (or perhaps nonlinear) structure remains a methodological challenge (Borsboom et al., 2016). Further, the dimension model is incomplete, because some psychopathology re /uniFB02 ects noncontinuous causality, such as early neural injury or rare gene mutation of strong effect.\n\nFourth, aside from such rare structural DNA variants or major teratogenic exposures, biological signals are weak: associations of individual genes or neural /uniFB01 ndings with clinical conditions are very small. Although mapping at the group level of biological and neural correlates remains important, and may be aided decisively by phenotype re /uniFB01 nement (Nigg, Karalunas, et al., 2020) so as to support clinical care, the long search for de /uniFB01 nitive single biomarkers of individual disorders appears ill conceived for the vast majority (Harrington, 2019; Kapur et al., 2012; Miller, 1996). No isomorphism exists between the main population of psychopathology phenotypes and biology. This is not to devalue the role of the biological lens (see below), but to highlight the necessity of a multiunit perspective (Cicchetti, 2016). 3\n\n## Development in Relation to Expectable and Expected Environment\n\nLiability may be present before or at birth (Gustafsson et al., 2020; Neumann et al., 2020), but psychopathology itself is not -it emerges in stages, with recognizable homo- and heterotypic continuities. Some conditions emerge early in development (attentionde /uniFB01 cit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder, oppositional de /uniFB01 ant disorder, learning disorders) and are seen as neurodevelopmental. Others have peak onset from the pubertal transition through the adolescent-young adult transition (mood disorders, psychoses, addictions, eating disorders; Martel, 2013) -although they may also have early neurodevelopmental roots (Corsi-Zuelli &amp; Deakin, 2021; Eyles, 2021; Kloiber et al., 2020; Mansur et al., 2020; Schmidt &amp; Mirnics, 2015). Intervention and prevention differ across developmental periods (preschool, adolescent transition, early adult transition; e.g., Nigg, Sibley, et al., 2020).\n\nDevelopment proceeds in the context of a species-wide expectable environment , or range of environments, within which normative programmed processes unfold. For example, humans ' expect ' speech from which they can learn language; they ' expect ' certain nutrients and are ready to utilize them. They do not expect extreme emotional neglect, or measurable levels of lead and organophosphate pesticides. The contemporary environment includes rare as well as common nonexpectable exposures (see Exposome section later).\n\nRelated to this, developmental origins theory posits that the fetus responds dynamically to physiological signals from the mother, which themselves are indices of her environment. The fetal physiological and epigenetic response constitutes reprogramming of development in anticipation of a re /uniFB01 ned expected postnatal environment. In this view, maladjustment occurs not only when the environment is outside of the species-general expectable environment, but also when the speci /uniFB01 c attempted predication and adaptation from the actual maternal cues is mismatched with the actual postnatal environment. For example, a baby ' expecting ' a violent environment (e.g., due to material emotional trauma) may develop with enhanced impulsivity and aggression but be born into a relatively stable and safe setting (e.g., the mother has relocated to a better setting or the child is adopted) for which those traits are\n\n1 Thomas and Sharp (2019) suggest that theory develops from sketch , to schema , to testable model . I propose a sketch that may be close to a schema. I bypass de /uniFB01 nitions of mental disorder, de /uniFB01 ning normal versus abnormal, and essentialism. See (McNally, 2011) and (Wake /uniFB01 eld, 1992, 1999). The ' illness ' metaphor is fraught (Hudson, 1993) but may pertain for psychopathology as complex illness.\n\n2 With regard to distal causes, my argument is compatible with an evolutionary-adaptationist perspective (Ellis &amp; Del Giudice, 2019) although not reducible to it. The focus herein is more proximal.\n\n3 The classic view in developmental psychopathology (paralleled in neuroscience) refers to levels of analysis, such as social, psychological, neural, and genetic. Recent thinking has moved away from this language (Thomas &amp; Sharp, 2019). I use the term ' units ' to refer to these heretofore putative scales or levels of examination (see section on Mechanism and reduction later).\n\npoorly suited. 4 Research on these early programming origins of psychopathology remains nascent, but promising data are emerging (Lester et al., 2018; Monk et al., 2019; Morgan et al., 2020; Ostlund et al., 2019). Developmental origins theory is amenable to a dynamic systems perspective (Kaliush et al., 2021) and to epigenetics (Conradt et al., 2018).\n\nCritical developmental unknowns include (a) timing of exposure; (b) when and whether reprogramming changes risk versus responsivity to environment (Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2009; Belsky et al., 2019); and (c) when and how the postnatal environment, in particular the infant -caregiver relationship in early life, moderates prenatal programming.\n\n## Genotype -Environment Interplay\n\nThat genotype is important in psychopathology is beyond dispute -but it generally confers liability , not psychopathology per se. While recognizing the role of rare gene variants of large effect in some cases, the /uniFB01 eld ' s focus is now on polygenic liability involving many genes of small effect, and on the form of genotype-environment interplay.\n\nGenotype-environment interaction (GxE) can mean a speci /uniFB01 c physiological interplay of genotype and environment (e.g., genotypic regulation of how rapidly nutrients or toxicants are metabolized). In the polygenic context it means statistical dependency rather than biological process. In the decomposition of twin data, heritability can be in /uniFB02 ated by GxE involving shared environments (Purcell, 2002). These shared-withinfamily effects may well involve population-wide exposures. Thus, to the extent GxE is involved, the typically robust heritability of major psychiatric conditions elevates the importance of common exposures, especially those that are outside the evolutionary expectable range. Important examples in contemporary societies known to be relevant to psychopathology include ubiquitous chemical toxicants and over- and undernutrition, as documented in Table S1. Necessary are contextually-informed rather than context-free biomarker, mechanism, and genetic studies. When GxE is mechanistic, one mechanism is epigenetic, that is regulation of gene expression (see Epigenetics section below).\n\nGenotype-environment correlation (rGE) has two meanings. One is that environment can mediate genetic effects (called genetic nurturance) (Armstrong-Carter et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2018). For example, postnatal caregiving can transmit genetic effects even when alleles are not passed on (Armstrong-Carter et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2018), potentially reversing or amplifying genetic liability (Garg et al., 2018; Ribas-Fit\u00f3 et al., 2003). In the offspring this is a purely environmental effect. The second meaning occurs when the environment is correlated with the transmitted alleles, that is, confounded with genotype. This correlation can be passive (parents pass on genes for high IQ and also read more to their child), evocative (child evokes certain response related to child personality), or active (child chooses certain activities, in /uniFB02 uenced by personality, itself genetically in /uniFB02 uenced). These effects may be more notable for proximal (e.g., caregiving) than distal (e.g., air pollution) exposures. Crucially, the unknown frequency, timing, and magnitude of rGE effects in psychopathology leaves unresolved the mechanism behind many genetic and exposure /uniFB01 ndings as well as some GxE /uniFB01 ndings.\n\n## Exposome\n\nThe preceding highlights the importance of the exposome -the diversity of exposures to ' synthetic chemicals, dietary constituents, psychosocial stressors, and physical factors ' (Vermeulen et al., 2020, p. 392; Wild, 2005) that in /uniFB02 uence human development. Examples of developmental variation in response to both social context (e.g., rearing environment) and genotype/biology are legion (Fenesy et al., 2019; Gottlieb, 2007; Henry et al., 2018; Hinshaw &amp; Arnold, 2015; Meaney, 2010; O ' Donnell &amp; Meaney, 2020; Trentacosta et al., 2019; Tung &amp; Lee, 2017). The importance of the exposome is underscored by the burgeoning literatures on social determinants of health (Alegr\u00eda et al., 2018) and on cultural variation in development (Causadias &amp; Cicchetti, 2018). To realize the potential in the industrious mapping of the genome and the neural connectome, then, the /uniFB01 eld also needs a proper account of the exposome (Rager et al., 2020; Vermeulen et al., 2020). Again, see Table S1 for selected examples.\n\nPast efforts to establish a multiunit developmental account of the exposome for psychological development are foundational (Bronfenbrenner, 1977, 1979; Bronfenbrenner &amp; Ceci, 1994; Fearon, 2018; Wachs, 1999). The work of Bronfenbrenner (1979) and its subsequent elaborations laid a crucial framework. Marking progress in the /uniFB01 eld, Wachs et al. (2014) provided a detailed overview of the importance of early environment, allostatic load, and different sensitive periods for development (e.g., early life may be salient for neural development, longer periods salient for psychosocial and cognitive development). They also gave examples of early biological (e.g., nutrients) and psychosocial in /uniFB02 uences. In the past decade, fruits of this line of work have enabled developmental scientists to document many early exposures and interventions that impair or facilitate development, and to guide prevention interventions (Britto et al., 2017; Britto &amp; P\u00e9rez-Escamilla, 2013; Wachs et al., 2014). That progress dovetails with more recent work across a range of health outcomes applying newer computational tools (e.g., network analysis) to organize understanding of the exposome and associated, overlapping physiological responses (Vermeulen et al., 2020).\n\nYet the challenges remain daunting. Whereas some exposures are causal, for most substantial work remains to evaluate causal effects versus those that may be explained by genotype-environment correlation or other confound (Nigg et al., 2016; Riglin et al., 2020; Thapar &amp; Rice, 2020). Further, environmental continually moderates development (e.g., school environment, neighborhoods, peer relations, and parenting style; Wachs et al., 2014). Here too, the degree of causal in /uniFB02 uence remains poorly described. Finally, effect sizes and success rates for prevention interventions remain unsatisfying. Additional theoretical elaboration may open the door to superior mechanistic intervention and prevention, motivating both this essay and others in this section.\n\nThe /uniFB01 eld thus faces the extraordinary complexity of environmental inputs and their dynamic interplay with genotype and one another over time. High-level taxonomies of exposure (Wachs, 1999) are necessary, yet bely the deep granularity that a full accounting would require. For example, potentially hundreds of neuro-active chemicals are in commercial use and found in children ' s environments (Grandjean &amp; Landrigan, 2014); only a handful have undergone serious scienti /uniFB01 c study for effects on child brain development. Studying all of them and interactions among\n\n4 In human research, pre- and postnatal risk environments often display some continuity, e.g., psychosocial adversity. Even so, fetal adaptation may be insuf /uniFB01 cient to what the child later encounters.\n\nthem and with genetic risk, diet, stress, and other factors is prohibitive. That foreshadows my subsequent emphasis on hypothesized common mechanistic pathways.\n\n## Mental Appraisal and Evaluation of Experience\n\nIt is not just the ' objective ' exposome that matters. How people interpret and evaluate their situation is also important. News headlines alone testify to the central role in psychopathology of existential issues (meaning, value) and mental evaluations. For example, in some demographic groups in the United States, life expectancy has declined due to opioid addiction, suicide, and poor health. These early deaths have been referred to as deaths of despair (Case &amp; Deaton, 2020). Despair is existential. In another example, excessive expectations on children to achieve have been suggested as one factor in rising rates of ADHD identi /uniFB01 cation in western societies (Schef /uniFB02 er &amp; Hinshaw, 2014).\n\nMental processes like appraisal or evaluation, both automatized and deliberate, play an important role in depression (Hammen, 2018), anxiety (LeDoux &amp; Pine, 2016; Newman et al., 2013), aggression (Allen et al., 2018; Benjamin et al., 2018), and drug use and addiction (Neighbors et al., 2019; Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2019). Likewise, mental construal is associated with successful treatment or recovery from depression or anxiety, as well as associated remodeling of brain function or even structure (Lissemore et al., 2018; Matsuda et al., 2019; Porto et al., 2009; Yoshino et al., 2018). The power of placebo or social bonds to enhance health is well-known (Ysseldyk et al., 2018).\n\nIn short, people ascribe meaning to their experience using narrative, symbol, schema, appraisal, or evaluation, and goal-referents. Doing so is part of self-regulation (below). Such appraisals support adaptive stability, adjusting cognition, emotion, and behavior in ways that (when successful) improve resilience (overcoming challenge) and overall adaptation (Yao &amp; Hsieh, 2019; also see Table S2). Any account of mental disorder must address psychological self-regulation including mental evaluations (Garc\u00eda-Mieres et al., 2019; Izard, 1993; Rachman, 2016; Salsman et al., 2020; Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003).\n\nAdmittedly and crucially, the mental level is also idiographic and subjective. It stretches from cognitive evaluations (emphasized herein) to the human capacity for self-transcendence (art, music, religious ritual, symbol, experience) and the unassailable authority of subjective knowledge (knowing how I feel, who I love). The subjective experience is not directly accessible to scienti /uniFB01 c observation. Yet it cannot be simply dispensed with or theorized away. Rather, the interior aspect of mental disorder requires consideration in a scienti /uniFB01 c model to the extent possible. Its inclusion need not prevent a tractable theory (for discussion, see Schaffner, 2020).\n\n## Summary\n\nA theory of mental illness has to address four domains: (a) systems biology (pathophysiology via neuroscience, genetics, and physiology); (b) the exposome , including the proximal social-relational environment, nutrition, and wider social and toxicant exposures; (c) developmental timing and process and behavioral analysis (early origins and programming, behavioral learning history, developmental trajectory); and (d) mental/psychological processes (attributions, evaluations, beliefs, meanings, and subjective phenomenology; herein I emphasize evaluations ). I next clarify other key concepts before offering a theory sketch. To help navigate the next section, Table S2 provides a glossary of relevant, multivalent terms as I use them.\n\n## Conceptual Clarifications and Elements\n\n## Dynamic System\n\nFull articulation of a speci /uniFB01 c dynamic systems model is beyond the scope of this article (see Kalisch et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2017; Tay &amp; Lim, 2020). Figure 1 points to a simpli /uniFB01 ed model to describe, at different units of analysis, an epigenetic, common pathways framework of psychopathology. Dynamic system models\n\nFigure 1 Schematic for a Mechanistic-Cybernetic Model of Psychopathology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntwo-headedstraightarrow=bidirectionalinfluence;bidirectionalcurvedarrow=correlatedbutnot causalassociation(implementation);one-directionalarrows=directionalinfluences.\n\nNote . Each domain shown can be decomposed into component parts and relations (e.g., interacting elements of exposome, physiology, neural organization, or psychological selfregulation). The homeostatic system fails to adequately adapt to inputs from one or more of the perturbations (tan). Individual adaptation is supported or degraded by alterations in extrinsic (brown) risks and supports or intrinsic (blue) processes. Genetics can be a support or a risk so is in violet and is mediated and moderated as shown. Two-headed straight arrow = bidirectional in /uniFB02 uence; bidirectional curved arrow = correlated but not causal association (implementation); one-directional arrows = directional in /uniFB02 uences. See the online article for the color version of this /uniFB01 gure.\n\nare familiar in systems biology, neuroscience, clinical psychology, and developmental psychopathology (Cicchetti, 1984; Granic et al., 2016; Mascolo et al., 2016). Key axioms, drawing from developmental psychopathology and Craver ' s (2005, 2007) neuroscience-based view, include:\n\n- (a) Lower (smaller) units constrain but do not explain higher (larger or more complex) levels or units of analysis.\n- (b) Emergent properties are unique to the system as a whole and not reducible to its elements (see Table S2, for notation on issues with the idea of emergence ). Thus, mental activity and behavior and their dysfunctions are not static elements of a person, but emerge from internal processes interacting with one another and with the functional context (Miller &amp; Bartholomew, 2020). This view rejects eliminative reductionism (Table S2), which posits that smaller units of analysis will explain, and thus render super /uniFB02 uous, larger units. Craver (2005, 2007) points out that whereas eliminative reductionism (not his term) was highly productive in physics, chemistry, and molecular biology, it fails with dynamic systems (such as brain functioning or complex human behavior). At the same time, as noted in point (a), smaller units do still constrain the possibilities for larger units.\n- (c) Systems phenomena cannot be fully explained without including their own unit of analysis (for psychopathology, that unit is mental or psychological activity).\n- (d) The function of multiunit system components (whether ideations, emotions, behaviors, neurons, or genes) can be different in, and thus cannot be understood apart from, a particular functional context (Bertolaso &amp; Ratti, 2018). The system is nondeterminative, as well, due to participation of stochastic processes (e.g., in neurodevelopment; White, 2019). In biology, ' Cell-to-cell variability is an inherent and emergent property of populations of cells . . . no two genetically identical cells behave and look identical ' (Xavier da Silveira dos Santos &amp; Liberali, 2019, pp. 1495 &amp; 1499). In relation to psychopathology, see (Miller, 1996; Miller &amp; Bartholomew, 2020).\n- (e) Mutual regulation occurs among system components (component coaction). For example, top-down and bottom up processes mutually regulate one another.\n- (f) Thus, mechanism here means causal explanation (Nicholson, 2012; Thomas &amp; Sharp, 2019), not a machine-like linear process (see Table S2).\n- (g) Nonlinear change that includes phase transitions (organizational state changes) is incorporated across development.\n- (h) The system is self-organizing, and develops from lesser to greater complexity through cybernetic processes (feedback loops). The cybernetic principle is central to the present proposal. I highlight the importance of recursive adaptive processes as the system seeks to maintain homeostasis (equilibrium), thus providing both a ground of stability and canalization as well as dynamic development and change.\n\nThe idea of psychopathology emerging in the context of dynamic system properties is not new (Granic, 2005; LichtwarckAschoff et al., 2009). However, empirical evidence that psychopathology actually behaves like a dynamic system has accrued only recently (Kendler et al., 2011; Kuranova et al., 2020; LichtwarckAschoff et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2017; Schiepek et al., 2016; Schiepek et al., 2014; Wichers et al., 2015). With those data in support, I stipulate that psychopathology is not a static entity responding to linear, unidirectional inputs. Rather it emerges from dynamic system interplay (Miller &amp; Bartholomew, 2020). It is best understood at multiple units of analysis, with recursive dynamics over time (including processes of change and stabilizing/ canalizing processes), and in relation to the ecological context.\n\n## Stressor and Perturbation\n\nThe exposome provides support and scaffolding for development, but also introduces stress, challenge, or perturbation. In theories of early development and in the concept of allostasis and allostatic load, ' stressor ' is broadly de /uniFB01 ned as any pressure strong enough to activate an adaptive compensation (Guidi et al., 2021; Monk et al., 2019; Palego et al., 2021; Wachs et al., 2014). To avoid confusion with psychological stress alone, I use p erturbation to reference the panoply of chemical and social challenges to development from the exposome that are strong enough to require an adaptive psychobiological response (see Table S2). Perturbation and adaptation are universal and continuous, rather than isolated to a subset of individuals in emotional distress. When the process diverts into maladaptation, it is psychopathology.\n\n## Self-Regulation\n\nFrom a systems perspective, self-regulation means the adjustment of affect, thought, or action to maintain adaptation (Nigg, 2017; Table S2). It draws upon both extrinsic factors, such as social supports, and intrinsic factors, such as physiological responses and cognitive evaluations, operating in a mutually-regulating fashion. It depends on both (a) automatized bottom-up processes (typically anchored in physiological or subcortical-to-cortical response to perturbation) and (b) deliberate, top-down, goal-directed processes (explicit mental responses such as attribution, evaluation, planning, and problem solving, related to frontal cortical to subcortical neural projections). Top-down aspects of self-regulation (also referred to as self-control , Table S2) involve attentional control and executive function (Nigg, 2017).\n\nI propose self-regulation as a common or shared psychological mechanism across most of psychopathology. For example, via either automatic or cognitive routes, anxiety and mood disorders are related to failure to regulate affect, ADHD to dysregulation of impulse, and schizophrenia to dysregulation of motivation. As a result, it is not surprising that partially overlapping neural circuitry also is involved in these disparate conditions (Table S3).\n\nRegulatory mental and physiological processes (homeostatic/allostatic) are ubiquitous yet /uniFB01 nite. Importantly, they can be mapped conceptually (McRae &amp; Gross, 2020; Nigg, 2017; Sheppes et al., 2015), and computationally (Petzschner et al., 2021). Thus, a focus on self-regulation as a shared psychological or psychophysiological mechanism in psychopathology opens the door to modeling change as well as stability, creates a /uniFB01 nite focus for mechanism study across\n\na range of environmental perturbations and behavioral outcomes, and is amendable to computational study.\n\n## Etiology and Behavioral Epigenetics\n\n## Epigenetics: Overview\n\nA common biological pathway linking genetic and environmental in /uniFB02 uences is gene regulation . Sustained regulation of gene expression can result from epigenetic changes -heritable (across cell division, not necessarily human generations) changes to the genome that do not change the DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes can be caused by genes, by stochastic process, and crucially, by exposures. In the last case, they are a mechanism for implementation of GxE and a liability-exposure model. Indeed, at highly variable genetic sites, GxE or G \u00fe E appears to best explain many DNA methylation changes (Czamara et al., 2019; Czamara et al., 2021). I use epigenetics to mean biological mechanisms that modulate or at least tag gene expression changes (transcription modi /uniFB01 -cation; Table S2 provides further context).\n\nBehavioral epigenetics (Moore, 2015) has emerged in the past decade following more established lines of work in cellular and tissue epigenetics. Interest in epigenetic in /uniFB02 uence on complex behavior was activated by fundamental discoveries in the 1970s (in animals) that epigenetic changes could be related to exposures and preserved over time, yet also reversed. It is now recognized that epigenetic effects, including in response to environments, play a major role in brain development (M. Li et al., 2018) and that genetic and exposome in /uniFB02 uences on behavior and psychopathology are in part mediated by altered gene expression (Barker et al., 2018; Smigielski et al., 2020; Wheater et al., 2020). The elucidation of a biological mechanism by which experience modi /uniFB01 es gene action thus remains integrative and evocative for the /uniFB01 eld.\n\n## Epigenetics: Challenges and Cautions\n\nEpigenetics are too often assumed, even by psychologists, to re /uniFB02 ect mainly environmental input. While this assumption does have some support for psychopathology as noted above, genetic and stochastic processes also contribute (White, 2019). For example, newer studies that include genotype (MWAS \u00fe GWAS, Table S2) have indicated that peripheral DNA methylation in developmental psychopathologies like ADHD are also related to genes (Meijer et al., 2020; Mooney et al., 2020).\n\nAs with other biological signals, an epigenetic hypothesis faces the challenge of small associations for individual probes with psychopathology, at least in peripheral tissue. However, aggregated scores (e.g., MWAS principal components, region scores, or polyepigenetic scores targeting an exposure) may be more informative (O ' Donnell &amp; Meaney, 2020; Pries et al., 2017; Stevenson et al., 2020; Suarez et al., 2020). Note that like polygenic risk scores, they are not particularly informative about one particular mechanisms, but instead summarize various regulatory in /uniFB02 uences.\n\nA further limitation is that the epigenetic demonstrations relevant to psychopathology and the exposome emphasized maternal emotional stress or childhood maltreatment (O ' Donnell &amp; Meaney, 2020). The logic in that fascinating work needs to be extended to inform a wider range of exposures and outcomes (Table S1 and S3). Further, most basic knowledge about environmentally triggered epigenetic remodeling in /uniFB02 uences on behavior is from animal and insect studies. These are powerful due to their experimental control, but generalizing to humans is problematic. The human environment does not resemble the environment of a laboratory animal, and human capacity to adapt to a wide range of environments substantially exceeds that of other animals.\n\nFinally, studies in human behavior remain dif /uniFB01 cult for methodological reasons. DNA methylation varies across development (Mulder et al., 2021), with potential timing-speci /uniFB01 c effects (Cecil et al., 2016). Moreover, epigenetic signals vary by tissue and cell type. It is dif /uniFB01 cult to generalize from peripheral tissue to the brain (Bakulski et al., 2016; Conradt et al., 2018; Lappalainen &amp; Greally, 2017; Mooney et al., 2020; Oldenburg et al., 2020). Yet the living human brain is relatively inaccessible, so scientists seeking systemic effects rely mainly on indirect methods, each with important limitations (postmortem brains, animal models, peripheral tissue assays).\n\n## Epigenetics: Prospects and Importance\n\nThe challenges are real. Yet prospects for epigenetic insight into psychopathology are suf /uniFB01 ciently compelling as to commend integration in a dynamic model. The critical element is that epigenetic remodeling is dynamically responsive to the environment; it can exemplify experiential programming of gene expression (Meaney, 2010; O ' Donnell &amp; Meaney, 2020). As Table S3 documents, epigenetic involvement has begun to be identi /uniFB01 ed in a range of psychopathologies. Likewise, several psychopathology-relevant exposures have epigenetic sequelae (albeit, often studied only in nonhuman animals).\n\nEpigenetics elevates the importance of the exposome in development and anchors it back to biology. Epigenetic markers can index relevant exposures (in the context of genotype) as well as link to psychopathology (Richetto &amp; Meyer, 2020; again, see Table S3). In theory, common exposures in early development can provoke systemic epigenetic response (e.g., DNA methylation of an immunological gene network). Such a response might then be common to many psychopathologies, and detected in peripheral tissue later, even though the mechanistic effect was in the central nervous system. It would thus serve as a biomarker of exposure and potentially of a mechanism. Such biomarker identi /uniFB01 cation is promising for prior exposures (Noor et al., 2019; Richetto &amp; Meyer, 2020), even in peripheral tissue (Aghagoli et al., 2019). It could even be an exposome biomarker for a causal (mechanistic) effect if system wide effects occurred and were known. More dif /uniFB01 -cult but promising is that algorithmic epigenetic scores can be phenotype biomarkers (Stevenson et al., 2020; Suarez et al., 2020). In sharp contrast to these near term prospects, /uniFB01 nding mechanisms of epigenetic in /uniFB02 uence on complex phenotypes is a more distal possibility. 5\n\n## Part 2: Sketch of the Theory and Hypotheses\n\n## Theory Elements and Sketch: Overview and Recap of Perspective\n\nThe preceding discussion of exposome and mechanisms raises the level of complexity of to a potentially intractable degree. This state of affairs bedevils any nonsimplistic theory of psychopathology. However, if we stipulate that psychopathology emerges from\n\n5 Studies using bead-based arrays have provided tantalizing clues on both fronts (Smigielski et al., 2020). However, whole methylome and other sequencing may be necessary to describe mechanisms.\n\ndynamic adaptation attempts or their failure within a dynamic system, it becomes possible to propose common mechanisms cutting across psychopathology. Doing so makes the problem tractable. Here then is a sketch of a theory following on that premise.\n\n## Process\n\nHuman development is dynamic and nonlinear, unfolding in an emergent manner via greater and greater complexity, differentiation, and organization from conception forward, during which new properties emerge as complexity increases. Dynamically, a partially de /uniFB01 nable genetic architecture (Cross-Disorder group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2019) sets a liability for what we call psychopathology later. That genetic structure immediately encounters epigenetic changes in the germline from exposures to the parents, preconception, followed by the prenatal exposome. Then, throughout development, exposures continually serve to either stabilize or destabilize the dynamic processes of adaptation. Continually, the child and then the adult (the dynamic person-biology system), adapts more or less successfully in biological, physiological, and as the child matures, psychological (mental) spheres. This adaptive response includes alterations in neural development, mediated by chemical signaling (from mother-via-placenta-to fetus), and fetal and subsequent epigenetic change. Some of the epigenetic programming may be systemic and thus detectable as a biomarker in peripheral tissue later.\n\nThe adaptive process is recursive and continuous (i.e., cybernetic). Most perturbation is subtle enough that adaptation is easily attained or even strengthened. However, when the perturbation exceeds the capabilities of the system to adapt, then epigenetic, neural, and mental processes modify recursively in an attempt at adaptation that proves costly or becomes rigid or self-reinforcing, such that the individual is unable to adapt further. This sets the stage for or emerges as psychopathology, either relatively early (ADHD) or somewhat later and gradually (schizophrenia), perhaps only after further perturbation. Mental disorder thus emerges from a perturbation of a dynamic system that is unable to regain an adaptive equilibrium (or homeostasis) and instead canalizes into a maladaptive or unstable developmental course, culminating in frank psychopathology.\n\nFigure 2 Funnel Visualization\n\nNote . The available exposures, genotypes, and biochemical pathways potentially involved include the entire human biome and beyond (social context). However, it is hypothesized here that a small set of common regulatory or homeostatic mechanisms at the psychological and biological levels of analysis will participate in a disproportionate share of perturbations related to psychopathology. See the online article for the color version of this /uniFB01 gure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf genetic liability is high, then the perturbation may seem relatively minor (e.g., background toxicant exposure or suboptimal diet, maternal distress, losses that happen to everyone in life, temporary experimentation with drugs) such that perhaps most individuals would adapt without psychopathology. But an ill-timed or strong perturbation (frank physical abuse, moderately elevated lead exposure, perinatal complications, extreme maternal trauma, an unusual series of losses, or a rare genetic mutation of large effect) may disrupt adaptation and lead to psychopathology even when liability is only moderate. Figure 1 schematizes the model to this point.\n\n## Common Pathway Hypothesis\n\nA major obstacle to explaining psychopathology is the vastness of etiological inputs to the extraordinarily complex recursive processes that govern human behavior and cognition and maintain functional adaptation. To address this, a common pathways hypothesis proposes that a circumscribed set of characteristic mechanisms can be identi /uniFB01 ed within the relevant units of analysis, all in the regulatory domain. I hypothesize that the universe of mechanistic human self-regulatory processes is smaller than the universe of inputs or the complex combinations of behavioral and mental outputs. Figure 2 illustrates this logic. If correct, a /uniFB01 nite and tractable set of homeostatic processes would emerge as shared across a wide range of exposures and psychopathologies, across multiple units of analysis: genetically (e.g., neurodevelopmental pathways), biologically (e.g., chemical signaling), neurally (e.g., control systems), and psychologically (e.g., self-regulation processes and mental evaluations; Table S3).\n\nAt the same time, the ' funnel ' content in Figure 2 is not singular (I do not propose to boil mental disorder down to a brain system, or a physiological system, or a mental process). It requires mechanistic description across multiple units, each of which can then become avenues for potential intervention. The most appropriate unit or explanatory perspective can vary across conditions or individuals, yet can be constrained. Key nodes of causal action may occur biologically (placental modi /uniFB01 cation in response to infection, leading to alteration, or perhaps cost, in neural development); or cognitively (rumination in depression, sustained attribution-driven arousal in aggression or anxiety, body-perception in anorexia) and contribute to unfolding and sustained behavioral and biological change.\n\nFigure 3 Proposed Contents of Common Pathway or Funnel Elements, Represented at Different Levels of Size, Abstraction, or Analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote . Mechanisms to be described at each level are hypothesized to be /uniFB01 nite and fewer than the extrinsic inputs or behavioral and psychological outputs involved in psychopathology. Within level increasing granularity is used to explain mechanism. See the online article for the color version of this /uniFB01 gure.\n\nAs an analogy, consider the myriad bacteria and viruses that can cause illness -yet a single (multiunit) immune system responds to all of them. The response product (e.g., antibodies) is speci /uniFB01 c, but the response process is shared. Similarly, the cortical networks involved in higher order analytic thought and planning are activated for an in /uniFB01 nite range of complex problems or goal con /uniFB02 icts. The content solution a person thinks of is particular, but the supporting process is shared across dif /uniFB01 cult problems. From an evolutionary perspective, this ef /uniFB01 ciency of process is the only way for an organism to meet a potentially unlimited array of challenges -to have an all-purpose regulatory response that can adapt itself to an unknown array of different challenges.\n\nTo /uniFB02 esh out this idea, Figure 3 illustrates four critical levels or units of analysis and offers exemplar hypotheses for common mechanisms at each level. These can be considered as example working hypotheses. Space limitations preclude their critical evaluation here but Table S3 provides selective empirical support for their reasonableness. In network terminology, the task is to differentiate (a) the most important spatial nodes (unit of analysis), and (b) the most sensitive temporal nodes (third trimester, pubertal transition, other; Jones et al., 2019).\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\nI have noted that the most relevant level of analysis for a given subset of psychopathology may be at the mental/psychological level in some instances, but the biological or genetic level in others. This raises two important considerations.\n\nFirst, I reiterate that although it may seem that the emphasis on environmental perturbation restricts this proposal to trauma or stress-related disorders like depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), I propose that perturbations outside the evolutionary expected environment are common (see Exposome section). 6 These may represent nonshared environment in twin studies and contribute to heritability estimates if they are involved in GxE. I hypothesize that they in fact provoke epigenetic change and can lead to reorganization or, in dynamic systems language, a phase change toward atypical development. Because development is sequential and cumulative, with later skills relying on earlier ones to be in place, early negative 7 perturbations can lead to psychopathology at a later point (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder).\n\nA second potential misunderstanding of my argument is that dif /uniFB01 -culties in adaptation may seem reminiscent of dif /uniFB01 culties in coping, and most readily applicable to conditions like ADHD, oppositional de /uniFB01 ant disorder, anxiety, or depression. They may seem too weak an explanation for the dramatic breakdowns in perception, motivation, and circadian processes in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or severe depression. I reemphasize that adaptation includes physiological and epigenetic change, not only psychological coping. For example,\n\n6 Beyond the scope of this article is whether they were just as common in ancient times, when many psychopathologies were already known and have only become a little more common.\n\n7 Of course, positive exposures also occur that enhance resilience, such as extra breastfeeding or exceptional parenting, which are side-stepped here in the interest of length limits.\n\nschizophrenia likely has roots in early neurodevelopment, perhaps involving neuro-in /uniFB02 ammatory inputs (Corsi-Zuelli &amp; Deakin, 2021; Eyles, 2021; Schmidt &amp; Mirnics, 2015). A similar story may emerge for bipolar disorder, perhaps involving metabolic pathways rather than in /uniFB02 ammatory signaling systems (Kloiber et al., 2020; Mansur et al., 2020). These possibilities /uniFB01 t the current theory sketch.\n\n## Summary\n\nA central hypothesis is that multiple conditions will share speci/uniFB01 able biological, neural, and psychological mechanisms (Figure 2, Figure 3). The corollary hypothesis is that these will be involved in maintaining homeostasis (regulatory). Thus, recursive processes are involved in change and can be mapped dynamically across time. If this hypothesis is correct, substantial explanatory power will accrue through a /uniFB01 nite set of routes.\n\n## Hypotheses\n\n## Research Design Implications\n\nIn this section, I present hypotheses in schematic form. However, these come in the context of research design considerations. Many design recommendations from dynamic systems theorists are infeasible (e.g., requiring very dense time series data, which would be cost prohibitive for many multiunit studies). However, I note the following principles of design that follow from the present perspective:\n\n- (a) Emphasis on change over time (whether on very short time scales, as in dynamic regulation of heart rate or synchronization of neural networks), medium scales (e.g., changes across menstrual cycles), or long scales (development over several years).\n- (b) Emphasis on cybernetic processes as can be represented in multiple ways in graphical and other tools, such as network modeling (Jones et al., 2019; McNally, 2011).\n- (c) Designs that place biomarkers in ecological and interpersonal/ psychosocial context, and environmental studies in genetic and physiological context and consider their interplay.\n- (d) Dynamic systems models offer a suite of graphical analysis tools (e.g., state-space grids) that may be helpful when suf /uniFB01 -cient data are available, as noted by Kaliush et al. (2021). For further design suggestions related to dynamic systems in developmental psychopathology, see Granic et al. (2016).\n\nWhat follows extends from Figure 3 and is given partial support in Table S3. The hypotheses discussed in this section are also summarized in Table 1 for reference. Tests of each hypothesis would involve con /uniFB01 rming their shared involvement in extended types of psychopathology and across extended ranges of exposome pressures and determining whether effect sizes are suf /uniFB01 cient to be helpful in explanation. Their tests involve con /uniFB01 rming or rejecting the relevance of the proposed recursive effects in onset and course of disorder.\n\n## Epigenetic-Genetic Unit of Analysis\n\nThe smallest level is gene regulation. The theme is that DNA structure may set liability but the operative mechanism is regulation of gene expression (for an interesting perspective here see Turkheimer et al., 2014). Gene expression is genetically and epigenetically regulated. Epigenetic regulation serves a homeostatic function and should show dynamic associations with onset and course over time. Table 1 provides the very simple epigenetic hypotheses that follow here if the model is correct. The ideas in Table 1 have initial support, albeit mostly in studies of nonhuman animals (see Table S3). For research and clinical applicability, a dynamic model perspective would ask about change over time and recursive effects relative to risk and adaptation. For example, it would be useful to discover when and to what extent epigenetic remodeling follows versus precedes behavioral change after exposures. The hypothesis is that epigenetic alteration (or else gene expression itself) will show dynamic directional effects on behavior or on physiological or neural correlates of behavior, in a recursive manner (this would be refuted if directional change in epigenetic score or /uniFB01 nding was not mirrored by change in the target behavioral outcome; though again, small effect sizes are still expected). If supported, then composite scores re /uniFB02 ecting system-wide activity could function in clinical algorithms or in research models (Stevenson et al., 2020).\n\n## The Physiological Unit of Analysis\n\nSystems biology identi /uniFB01 es tens of thousands of potentially relevant molecules, proteins, and enzymes. However, it can be hypothesized that chemical signals critical to maintaining homeostasis are crucial (Dunn et al., 2020). A salient example is immunological signalers such as cytokines and chemokines (Dunn et al., 2020; Izvolskaia et al., 2020; Oppenheim, 2018). Table S3 illustrates the potential widespread involvement of immunological signaling molecules as common pathways in psychopathology. Of course, these interact in complex ways with related systems such as the microbiome, the aforementioned epigenetic signals, mitochondrial alterations, and brain glial cells, among other linkages. I hypothesize that, at the physiological level, this family or another like it will account for meaningful variance in early development and subsequently in relation to multiple psychopathologies (Na et al., 2014). Other key ligands include hormones regulating response to stress and energy balance. Clearly, the interplay of these examples with oxidative stress, HPA axis, and other systems invites a more extensive, yet still /uniFB01 nite, mapping.\n\nSpeci /uniFB01 c hypotheses are again listed in Table 1. In those hypotheses, I use immunological/in /uniFB02 ammatory signaling as the primary common pathway; this is a stand in for the clumsier statement that one or more common intercellular signaling systems should emerge as commonly affected across multiple kinds of exposures and psychopathologies. It may be that the particular signaling system affected varies across psychopathologies (e.g., immunological, HPA, metabolic). In this example, immunological functioning interacts closely with the microbiome (Tilg et al., 2020), so an associated hypothesis is included in Table 1. Dynamically, these hypotheses would expand to enable assessment of component change in relation to other units (e.g., neural reorganization, epigenetic remodeling, immunological signaling units).\n\n## The Neural Unit of Analysis\n\nI do not attempt to propose a new neural framework for regulatory functioning or homeostatic maintenance of mental life. However, recall from early in the article that while it is possible to conceive at least heuristically of disorder-speci /uniFB01 c neural networks (for one attempt, see Kandel, 2018), recent neuroimaging data strongly qualify such distinctions (T. Li et al., 2020). Instead, overlap and nonspeci /uniFB01 city seem to\n\nTable 1 Example Hypotheses at Four Scales, Levels, or Units of Analysis\n\n| Analysis                                                                        | Hypothesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Genetic and epigenetic                                                          | Epigenetic measures (e.g., DNA methylation profiles, algorithms, or principal components) will be detectable in relation to exposures that are associated with psychopathology (Smigielski et al., 2020). They can introduce both stable markings of exposure (e.g., DNA methylation scores of lifetime smoking or in utero smoking exposure) and at the same time change dynamically in response to exposure over time, in which case change will in turn be associated with behavior or exposure change in recursive pattern until stability is reached. Epigenetic signals associated with a common adaptive system such as immunological func- tion will be identified across multiple psychopathologies, as recently seen for schizophre- nia (Smigielski et al., 2020) and ADHD (Neumann et al., 2020). However, these signals at the specific level will include both general (most psychopathologies) and specific (to par- ticular kinds of psychopathology) signals. Epigenetic algorithms that index exposure will map to exposures related to psychopathology (Richetto & Meyer, 2020) using peripheral tissue measures and ultimately be verified in relation to neurodevelopment, indexing a biomarker of system-wide compensatory response. Similar approaches can be used to index treatment response or responsivity (Gardea-Resendez et al., 2020; Goud Alladi et al., 2018). For example, it will be possible to create epigenetic profiles related to stress, inflammatory activity, smoking, alcohol ex- posure, or other exposures (Stevenson et al., 2020) that will be combinable to map a risk or exposome profile for a given child and then related to brain or cognitive development. |\n| Physiological/cellular                                                          | ferences related to psychopathology. Higher systemic inflammation /immune response (or alternative signaling response system) will be seen in women whose offspring go on to develop psychopathology. The same common signals seen in women whose offspring develop psychopathology will also be seen elevated in individuals with psychopathology (Goldsmith &Rapaport, 2020). Anti-inflammatory intervention in early life will mitigate impacts of multiple known risk fac- tors (e.g., dietary, metabolic, toxicant) for multiple conditions (Thompson et al., 2018). Such intervention may also reduce psychopathology symptoms across multiple disorders (Fond et al., 2020). Microbiome signals (perhaps related to dietary response; Bordeleau et al., 2020) will emerge as an influence in multiple psychopathologies (Tilg et al., 2020). Dynamic change in cell signaling summary scores or targeted mechanistic measures will interact with epigenetic or neural change in dynamic, recursive fashion. Individual varia- tion in change of the dynamic direction or set point will relate to psychopathology risk or severity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Neural (multiple levels exist within neural of course; here only two are noted) | Changes in brain regulatory structures or networks, either at the macro level (e.g., control networks) or micro level (e.g. microglia function) will change recursively with change in epigenetic or physiological signals and mediate behavioral change in dynamic, bidirec- tional fashion over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Psychological (also called mental, cognitive)                                   | Self-regulation of cognition, affect, or behavior can be identified as a functional mechanism in multiple psychopathologies.

Within a /uniFB01 nite set of key processes, speci /uniFB01 c contents are unique to the individual (particular ways of making meaning, or interpreting their experience). An analogy might be the /uniFB01 nding that the equation for reward discounting appears the same across many species, whereas parameter weights vary across species and incentive context. Two related processes, each able to be mechanistically decomposed (at least in principle), are salient.\n\nThe /uniFB01 rst, overarching process is intrinsic self-regulatory processes . I previously noted that self-regulation involves an interplay of automatic and intentional (goal directed) processes or mental activities (Nigg, 2017). Top down elements appear to be shared across a range of psychopathologies. For example, attentional control (Burgoyne &amp; Engle, 2020) supports executive functioning, emotional regulation, and /uniFB02 uid intelligence; its breakdowns are observed in in ADHD, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and PTSD (Table S3).\n\nThe second, a component of the /uniFB01 rst, is appraisal schema , or evaluations . Evaluations are both implicit (nonconscious) and explicit. They serve to help regulate emotion, confer meaning, and thus guide behavior (Tamir, 2021). Implicit evaluative representations can occur in a wide range of psychopathologies (Teachman et al., 2019) both a mechanism and an outcome. Recent theories propose a continuous iterative process by which mental evaluations are continuously updated, with implicit processes followed up by explicit (conscious) revision (Cunningham &amp; Zelazo, 2007; Ehret et al., 2015; Tamir, 2021). Implicit evaluations are dif /uniFB01 cult but not impossible to measure (Teachman et al., 2019). Mental evaluations can be thought of as a seamless element of the continuous dynamic of homeostatic stabilization that constitutes psychological regulation. They are a common pathway for much psychopathology (see Figure 3, Table S3, and Table 1).\n\n## Clinical and Prevention Relevance\n\nCan a multilevel dynamic proposal inform applied problems? I noted early on the relevance of multilevel models to risk prevention efforts. All of the mechanisms noted in this essay are already recognized as potential mechanisms for intervention; proposed here is the potential to integrate them around epigenetic and dynamic processes. Mascolo et al. (2016) provide extensive elaboration on how their approach to dynamic systems should inform clinical practice; many of their suggestions hold here. A central one is a shift in conceptualization away from static conditions with linear inputs, and toward an emergent formulation (this is consistent with a developmental psychopathology perspective as well). It also highlights the value of sequential behavioral analysis in clinical evaluation. Kaliush et al. (2021) suggest that clearer identi /uniFB01 cation of phase-state transition periods, particularly in early life, could enrich a prevention focus. As mathematical description of these processes rapidly improves, targeted intervention should improve as well. 8 Further, clinical algorithms could utilize composite scores re /uniFB02 ecting system-wide activity in brain, such as a polyvertex score (Zhao et al., 2019) or related score for functional networks (Mooney et al., 2021), or epigenetic or physiological summary scores (Stevenson et al., 2020). These would target regulatory process and could become indices of clinical change (the complexity of interpreting poly-scores notwithstanding).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe goal of mental health intervention at a human level is to support, heal, and help a struggling person. Restating the goal in the dry language of a schematic theory, it is to reestablish homeostasis, perhaps at a new set point, for a faltering dynamic system. Doing so can include introducing new information (biologically or cognitively), adding supports (e.g., social), or providing opportunity for reorganization (e.g., new environmental niches).\n\nKey gaps in knowledge include: (a) insuf /uniFB01 cient mapping of the exposome; (b) underemphasis on causally informative designs; (c) insuf /uniFB01 cient cross-fertilization of genetic, physiological, psychological, and exposure studies (i.e., the problem of decontextualized biomarker studies); (d) insuf /uniFB01 cient joining of prenatal and postnatal in /uniFB02 uences in the same cohorts (which is beginning to change); and (e) slow application to developmental studies of psychopathology of network and other system-modeling tools or to multiunit dynamics.\n\nDeveloping the present sketch or theory schema would entail mapping the dynamics of a system seen at multiple units of analysis including genetic liability, exposures of varying signi /uniFB01 cance, epigenetic response, and regulation of brain development, and psychological processes involved in self-regulation including mental evaluations. A key challenge concerns how to map patterns of recursive feedback (cybernetic processes) over time within and across units of analysis. Initial developmental trajectories may be reversible in many instances once these mechanisms are better understood. However, at present sensitive periods of development (where in dynamic systems terms, phase shifts are likely to occur), and mechanisms of stabilizing someone in a maladaptive state, are still only partially elucidated.\n\nIn terms of priorities for the /uniFB01 eld, the complexity of the bio-psychological system of the person can be focused for scienti /uniFB01 c purposes on (a) mapping of the exposome (as in the ECHO consortium effort); (b) testing of mechanistic hypotheses involved in the epigenome and in key chemical communication systems (in /uniFB02 ammatory factors and stress hormones); (c) more use of longitudinal network and other models that can track recursive processes over time in relation to phenotypic expression. I have sketched the beginnings of testable hypotheses.\n\nOverall, the core hypothesis is that neurobiological and psychological pathways of in /uniFB02 uence are /uniFB01 nite and represent shared mechanisms across many psychopathologies. I hypothesized that this is because their function is regulatory, and that the human bio-psychological system has a /uniFB01 nite number of multipurpose processes that adapt to varying pressures (immune response is an exemplar). Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the face of environmental pressure is an essential mechanism to include, and not merely a metaphor for development, even though its central role\n\n8 Mathematical description of neural, cognitive, and behavioral dynamic processes is advancing rapidly. It will be increasingly tractable to quantify perturbations and the recursive process around them while considering individual variations in parameter weightings for /uniFB01 nite (if extensive) process equations.\n\nremains to be fully determined. The principle of common regulatory processes is re /uniFB02 ected in different units of analysis such as the physiological (cell signaling), the psychological (evaluations and other intrinsic self-regulatory mental processes), and their corresponding implementing neural networks.\n\nA /uniFB01 nite (albeit complex) set of these processes respond to the array of inputs relevant to psychopathology and produce its speci /uniFB01 c forms as their content, as schematized in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In this dynamic context, while the vast complexity of neural and psychological processes is involved, and the potential inputs and outputs are vast, the critical mechanisms (de /uniFB01 ned in dynamic systems theory as controlling processes) shaping mental disorder are /uniFB01 nite and isolated to regulatory systems.\n\nTesting this logic requires a shift away from studies of single inputs (just the genome, or just a given environmental risk) or single domains of psychopathology, toward integrated study of multiple psychopathology and risk factors. It can be targeted on a-priori hypotheses of which the possibilities can be limited to adaptive processes. While multiple psychopathologies should be studied, units can be studied in subsets so long as they are subsequently connected to other units in an integrated explanation. Thus, the tools are already in place to undertake novel tests and to develop the approach outlined in this essay.\n\n## References\n\n- Achenbach, T. M. (2020).

For Enlitens, this research serves as a powerful analogue and strategic roadmap for replacing a traditional, passive methodology (standardized testing) with an interactive, collaborative one (the Enlitens Interview). The paper demonstrates that alternative methods can yield superior results and achieve high user satisfaction, and, most importantly, it offers a detailed guide to overcoming the exact types of institutional, peer, and client resistance that Enlitens faces.\n\n## FILENAME\n\nFagen\\_Crouch\\_Mazur\\_2002\\_Peer\\_Instruction\\_Results\\_evidence\\_for\\_alternative\\_methods.md\n\n## METADATA\n\n- Primary Category : RESEARCH\n- Relevance : Supporting\n- Document Type : research\\_article\n- Key Topics : alternative\\_methods, pedagogy, interactive\\_engagement, data-driven\\_advocacy, overcoming\\_resistance, conceptual\\_understanding\n- Tags : #PeerInstruction, #ActiveLearning, #AlternativeMethods, #EvidenceBasedPractice, #HigherEducation, #Skepticism, #SystemsChange, #Pedagogy\n\n## CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENlitens\n\n- \"Correspondence and informal discussions indicate a user base of hundreds of instructors around the world who teach with PI, yet to date there has been no systematic study of PI implementation and effectiveness in the variety of settings in which it is used.\"\n- \"Many successful users of Peer Instruction indicate that they had to overcome a number of challenges, which we describe here along with solutions suggested by the respondents.\"\n- \"Thus, the vast majority of instructors completing our survey consider their experiences with PI to be successful.\"\n- \"Ten percent of respondents report that their colleagues are skeptical of the benefit of student discussions that take away lecture time.\"\n- \"A third of these instructors report addressing this skepticism by collecting data on student learning gains.\"\n- \"Because most students are unaccustomed to active participation in science classes, some feel uncomfortable participating in discussions, or initially consider the discussions a waste of time.\"\n- \"In summary, the PI survey results indicate that most of the assessed PI courses produce learning gains commensurate with interactive engagement pedagogies, and more than 300 instructors (greater than 80%) consider their implementation of Peer Instruction to be successful.\"\n- \"Persistence in using Peer Instruction in the face of initial student resistance is important...\"\n- \"Over 90% of those using the method plan to continue or expand their use of PI.\"\n\n## KEY STATISTICS &amp; EVIDENCE\n\n- Survey Size : More than 700 instructors completed a survey, with 384 identified as using Peer Instruction (PI).\n- Quantitative Effectiveness (FCI Scores) : 81% of PI users who collected quantitative data used the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).\n- User Satisfaction : Of 384 PI users, 303 definitely planned to use PI again, and 29 probably would.

The language of the survey was purposely broad in order to include instructors who had used a strategy similar to PI without being aware of our work; we therefore received responses from many instructors using other collaborative learning strategies.\n\n## PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\n\n## Peer Instruction Challenges and Solutions\n\nMany successful users of Peer Instruction indicate that they had to overcome a number of challenges, which we describe here along with solutions suggested by the respondents.\n\n- Challenge: Time and Energy to Develop Materials Thirteen percent of instructors cite the time and energy required to develop ConcepTests as an impediment to using PI. Developing good ConcepTests certainly takes a great deal of effort; to minimize duplication of this effort, and to make PI easier to implement, we and other developers of ConcepTests have made online databases of ConcepTests for introductory physics, chemistry, and astronomy freely available.\n- Challenge: Time Constraints and Curriculum Coverage About 9% of respondents report that the quantity of material to cover in a semester often makes it difficult to devote class time to ConcepTests. One-tenth of these instructors reduce the amount of material covered by the course, but the majority do not have the freedom to do so. One option for those bound by a lengthy syllabus is to require students to learn some of the material on their own, especially by assigning reading of the text before class.\n- Challenge: Colleague Skepticism Ten percent of respondents report that their colleagues are skeptical of the benefit of student discussions that take away lecture time. A third of these instructors report addressing this skepticism by collecting data on student learning gains. One particularly effective approach is to compare achievement of students taught with and without PI on identical exams. Others suggest inviting skeptical colleagues to sit in on a class, sharing positive student feedback with them, or even giving the assessment tests to other faculty.\n- Challenge: Student Resistance to the Method Another challenge is students' resistance to the method (7% of respondents). Because most students are unaccustomed to active participation in science classes, some feel uncomfortable participating in discussions, or initially consider the discussions a waste of time. Thus, respondents report that it is essential to thoroughly explain the use of PI to their students. Persistence in using Peer Instruction in the face of initial student resistance is important; 15 (4%) users report that, while their students were initially skeptical of PI, the students warmed up to it as they found the method helped them learn the material. Regularly presenting class-averaged data on student performance also shows students that the method is helping them and thus may also motivate students.\n- Challenge: Engaging All Students A related challenge is the difficulty in fully engaging students in class discussions (7% of respondents). In the words of one instructor, \"some students were too cool, too alienated, or perhaps too lost to participate\". Nearly half of those citing this challenge say it is important for the instructor to circulate through the classroom during the group discussion of the ConcepTest, helping to guide and encourage students in discussion. Other students may be motivated by receiving credit for participation and by the presence of ConcepTest-like conceptual questions on exams.",

This document is essential for Enlitens as it provides a vivid, lived-experience illustration of neurodiversity, demonstrating a valid and highly effective \"bottom-up\" thinking style that contrasts with typical linear thought. Grandin also proposes a groundbreaking model of three distinct specialized thinking types in autism (visual, pattern, and verbal), underscoring the need for individualized, strengths-based assessment and directly critiquing the validity of standard IQ tests like the Wechsler scales.\n\n## FILENAME\n\nGrandin\\_2009\\_Visual\\_Thinking\\_in\\_Autism\\_Personal\\_Account.md\n\n## METADATA\n\n- Primary Category : NEURODIVERSITY\n- Relevance : Core\n- Document Type : personal\\_account/review\n- Key Topics : visual thinking, lived experience, Temple Grandin, cognitive styles, bottomup processing, assessment critique, autism, neurodiversity\n- Tags : #visual\\_thinking, #lived\\_experience, #Temple\\_Grandin, #autism, #cognitive\\_styles, #bottom\\_up\\_thinking, #assessment\\_critique, #strengths\\_based, #heterogeneity, #neurodiversity\n\n## CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS\n\n\"My mind is similar to an Internet search engine that searches for photographs. I use language to narrate the photo-realistic pictures that pop up in my imagination.\" \"When I design equipment for the cattle industry, I can test run it in my imagination similar to a virtual reality computer program.\" \"All my thinking is associative and not linear.\" \"All my thinking is bottom-up instead of top-down. I find lots of little details and put them together to form concepts and theories.\" \"Since my mind stores information as photo-realistic pictures, I do not have true abstract thinking. To visualize the concept of my future after high school, I had to use door symbols.\"\n\n\"I have concluded that there are three principal types of specialist thinking.\"\n\n\"Dawson and colleagues found that the IQ scores for the autistic children were 30-70 percentile points higher on the Raven's compared with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), while normal children have similar IQ scores when given the Raven's and the WISC.\"\n\n\"These results show that autistic intelligence is truly different.\"\n\n\"In my case, abstract thought based on language has been replaced with high-speed handling of hundreds of 'graphics' files.\"\n\n## KEY STATISTICS &amp; EVIDENCE\n\n- Raven's vs. Wechsler IQ : Citing the work of Dawson et al. cite\\_start, Grandin notes that IQ scores for autistic children were 30 to 70 percentile points higher on the Raven's Progressive Matrices compared to the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). In contrast, non-autistic children score similarly on both tests.\n- Brain Imaging (General) : Citing Kana et al. cite\\_start, Grandin notes that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that in people with autism, word-based tasks are processed in the visual parts of the brain.\n- Brain Imaging (Personal) : Dr. Grandin reports that a diffusion tensor imaging scan performed on her in https://www.google.com/search?q=2006 by Nancy Minshew and colleagues revealed a \"huge white fibre tract that runs from deep in my visual cortex up to my frontal cortex.\" She states it is \"almost twice as large as my sex- and age-matched controls.\"\n\n## THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS\n\nThree Types of Specialized Autistic/Asperger Thinking Based on her experiences and interviews, Temple Grandin proposes a model of three distinct cognitive types within the autism spectrum.\n\n- (i) Photo-realistic visual thinkers : This is the category Grandin places herself in.\n- Strengths : Design, mechanics, and any work requiring visualization. They can \"see everything in my head and then draw it on paper.\"\n- Cognition : All thoughts are in photo-realistic pictures. Thinking is associative, not linear. Concepts are formed by sorting specific pictures into categories.\n- Weaknesses : Algebra, because it cannot be visualized.\n- Cognition : Thoughts are in patterns rather than photo-realistic pictures. These thinkers see patterns and relationships between numbers.\n- (ii) Pattern thinkers music and math mind : This is described as a more abstract form of visual thinking.\n- Strengths : Excelling in math and music.\n- (iii) Verbal specialists / Word fact thinkers : This type excels in verbal domains.\n- Weaknesses : May have problems with reading or writing composition.\n- Cognition : Possess a huge memory for verbal facts on a wide variety of topics.\n- Strengths : Good at talking and writing.\n- Weaknesses : Often poor at drawing and other visual thinking skills.\n\nBottom-Up, Associative Thinking Grandin describes her primary cognitive process as bottomup and associative.\n\n- Process : She gathers many small, specific pieces of data (visual images from experience or reading) and puts them together to form concepts and theories, much like completing a jigsaw puzzle without knowing the final picture. This contrasts with topdown thinking, where one starts with a theory and fits data into it.\n- Concept Formation : Concepts are formed by sorting photo-realistic pictures into categories based on shared sensory features. For example, she learned to differentiate dogs from cats by identifying a specific visual feature (nose shape) that all dogs share, regardless of size.\n\n## POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS\n\nThis entire document is a detailed account of a specific autistic cognitive style-photo-realistic visual thinking. It provides a rich, qualitative description of how this neurotype experiences the world, processes information, and solves problems.\n\n- Associative Memory : Grandin describes how memories are accessed in a non-linear, associative web. The word \"butterfly\" triggers a sequence of images from butterflies in her yard, to decorative metal butterflies, to a painting she did, to a \"butterfly cut of chicken\" from a recent meal.\n- Lifelong Development : She notes that her cognitive and social abilities improved significantly with age, particularly between 40 and 60, as her mental \"database\" of images and experiences grew. This contradicts the notion that development ceases after childhood.\n- Visual Symbols for Abstract Concepts : Lacking \"true abstract thinking,\" Grandin explains that as a teenager, she had to use concrete visual symbols, like doors she could walk through, to conceptualize her future.\n- Uneven Profile of Abilities : The model of three specialized thinkers directly addresses the \"uneven profile of abilities\" found in many autistic individuals, explaining it as a tradeoff where specialization in one area comes at the expense of others.\n\n## ASSESSMENT CRITIQUE\n\nGrandin provides a strong critique of traditional intelligence testing and advocates for alternative methods that recognize different cognitive styles.\n\n- Wechsler IQ Tests : Grandin explicitly supports the research of Michelle Dawson and Laurent Mottron showing that Wechsler IQ tests are inappropriate for many autistic individuals. She cites their finding that autistic children score 30-70 percentile points higher on the Raven's Progressive Matrices, a non-verbal pattern-reasoning test.\n- Raven's Progressive Matrices : Grandin explains that this test is more suitable because it involves identifying the pattern that completes a complex series, a task that aligns with the pattern-thinking strengths of some autistic individuals.\n- True Intelligence is Different : She concludes from this research that \"autistic intelligence is truly different\" and not adequately captured by traditional, often languageheavy, IQ tests.",

(2021) - American Psychological Association Convention\n\n## Why This Matters to Enlitens\n\nThis presentation documents how a major children's hospital system successfully implemented comprehensive telehealth autism assessment using primarily interview-based methods, achieving diagnostic accuracy comparable to in-person evaluation while dramatically increasing accessibility. This provides institutional validation for several key components of the\n\nEnlitens model. The rationale behind its importance: When traditional medical institutions adopt interviewbased telehealth approaches and achieve success, it legitimizes our more revolutionary clinical interview model and demonstrates that the field is already moving away from traditional testing paradigms.\n\n## The Core VEDA Model Components That Align With Enlitens\n\n## Gold-Standard Interview Approach\n\n\"Added gold standard interview measure (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised; ADI-R)\" replaced traditional standardized testing with comprehensive clinical\n\nThe VEDA model interviews as their primary diagnostic tool.\n\n## Flexible Behavioral Observation\n\n## \"Created flexible space for behavior observation (AVABO)\"\n\nInstead of rigid standardized protocols, they developed \"an observation protocol (AVABO) created to allow clinicians to partner with parents to engage a child in activities highlighting social communication skills.\"\n\n## Individualized Assessment Pathways\n\n## \"Allow further individualization of assessment pathways based on child needs\"\n\nThe rationale for these alignments: Even traditional medical systems recognize that standardized approaches are insufficient and that clinical interview methods combined with flexible observation provide superior diagnostic accuracy.\n\n## Dramatic Success Statistics That Validate Our Approach\n\n## Diagnostic Accuracy Without Traditional Testing\n\n## \"88% of cases that were seen were able to provide a definitive diagnosis without additional in person assessment\"\n\nThis means that clinical interviews and flexible observation were sufficient for definitive diagnosis in nearly 9 out of 10 cases , without relying on traditional standardized testing batteries.\n\n## Maintained Assessment Volume During Crisis\n\n\"The VEDA model (during the COVID 19 pandemic) allowed the center to serve a similar volume of patients as the previous year\"\n\n## Comparable Diagnostic Outcomes\n\n- Similar diagnostic rates between telehealth and in-clinic samples\n- Only 10.71% of telehealth assessments required deferral due to telehealth limitations\n- No significant difference in diagnostic accuracy\n\nWhy these statistics matter: They prove that comprehensive clinical interview approaches can achieve diagnostic accuracy equal to traditional methods while being more accessible and efficient.\n\n## Evidence That Supports Our Revolutionary Model\n\n## Accessibility Revolution\n\nThe VEDA model successfully addressed \"barriers related to transportation difficulties and distance, allowing service providers to better reach underserved populations\" - exactly the accessibility issues that Enlitens targets.\n\n## Elimination of Traditional Testing Barriers\n\n\"Overcome barriers to accessing services including: Transportation and geographical location, Time missed from work, Need for child care, Family stress\"\n\n## High Stakeholder Satisfaction\n\n## Clinician Acceptability Scores (1-5 scale):\n\n- Acceptability: 4.10\n- Feasibility: 4.27\n- Appropriateness: 4.05\n\n## Patient Satisfaction:\n\n91% rated their experience as \"Good\" or \"Excellent\"\n\nThe rationale for this evidence: When both clinicians and families prefer interview-based telehealth approaches over traditional testing, it validates the fundamental principles underlying the Enlitens model.\n\n## Key Methodological Innovations That Mirror Our Approach\n\n## Interdisciplinary Clinical Teams\n\n\"Psychologists and Psychology Trainees, Developmental Pediatricians, Speech Therapist, Genetic Counselor, Psychometricians, Social Work, and Family Advocate\"\n\n## Multiple Information Sources\n\n## \"Multiple sources of data\"\n\nrather than relying on single standardized measures\n\n## Comprehensive Clinical Assessment\n\nThe model \"encompasses entire assessment process\" rather than focusing on isolated testing components\n\n## Emphasis on Clinical Judgment\n\n## \"DSM-5 criteria and clinical judgment were also utilized in diagnosis\"\n\nWhy these innovations matter: They demonstrate that successful autism assessment requires exactly the comprehensive, individualized, clinically-focused approach that forms the foundation of Enlitens' model.\n\n## Institutional Recognition of Assessment Evolution\n\n## Need for Comprehensive Models\n\n\"Need still exists for: A model for telehealth assessment that encompasses entire assessment process, Comprehensive telehealth model to assess children across the age span\"\n\n## Recognition of Accessibility Crisis\n\n\"Innovative assessment models for Autism Spectrum Disorder can increase access to services\"\n\n## Acknowledgment of Traditional Limitations\n\nThe development of VEDA itself represents recognition that traditional in-person standardized testing approaches are insufficient for meeting current assessment needs.\n\nThe rationale for this recognition: When major medical institutions acknowledge the need for revolutionary assessment approaches, it validates our position that traditional methods are inadequate for current demands.\n\n## Implementation Success That Validates Scalability\n\n## Rapid Large-Scale Implementation\n\n\"The model was quickly scaled in a large hospital clinic setting\" during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n## Sustainable Operations\n\n\"Continue at near typical rates\" for assessment volume\n\n## Future Development Plans\n\n- \"Further develop our observation protocols\"\n- \"Work to establish standards of practice for telehealth\"\n- \"Increase use of virtual follow up testing to allow for more individualized recommendations\"\n\nWhy implementation success matters: It proves that comprehensive interview-based assessment models can be successfully implemented at scale, countering arguments that individualized approaches are impractical.\n\n## Areas Where Enlitens Goes Beyond VEDA\n\n## Revolutionary Accessibility\n\nWhile VEDA improved access within traditional systems, Enlitens eliminates systemic barriers entirely through direct-pay models and radical cost reduction.\n\n## Complete Standardized Testing Elimination\n\nVEDA still incorporated some standardized measures (CARS-2), while Enlitens completely eliminates reliance on standardized testing.\n\n## Neurodiversity-Affirming Approach\n\nVEDA operates within medical model frameworks, while Enlitens embraces neurodiversityaffirming perspectives that challenge deficit-based diagnostic paradigms.\n\n## True Individualization\n\nWhile VEDA offered \"individualized pathways,\" Enlitens provides completely customized assessment experiences tailored to each person's unique presentation and needs. The rationale for going beyond: systems, but Enlitens represents the complete revolution that the autism community actually\n\nVEDA represents significant progress within traditional needs.\n\n## Validation for Our Core Arguments\n\n## Clinical Interviews Are Superior\n\nVEDA's success with the ADI-R as their \"gold standard interview measure\" validates our emphasis on comprehensive clinical interviews over standardized testing.\n\n## Telehealth Is Effective\n\n88% definitive diagnosis rate proves that remote clinical assessment can achieve accuracy equal to or better than traditional in-person methods.\n\n## Individualization Is Essential\n\nVEDA's focus on \"individualized assessment pathways\" acknowledges what Enlitens has always known - one-size-fits-all approaches fail autistic individuals.\n\n## Accessibility Is Critical\n\nTheir emphasis on overcoming \"barriers to service access\" validates our mission to make assessment available to underserved populations.\n\nWhy this validation matters: When traditional medical institutions adopt approaches that mirror key aspects of our revolutionary model and achieve success, it provides powerful evidence that our direction is correct.\n\n## Institutional Evidence for Our Revolution\n\n## Medical System Recognition of Change\n\nThe fact that Nationwide Children's Hospital developed VEDA demonstrates that even traditional medical systems recognize the inadequacy of current assessment approaches.\n\n## Successful Alternative Implementation\n\nVEDA's success proves that alternatives to traditional testing-heavy models can work effectively at institutional scale.\n\n## Stakeholder Demand for Innovation\n\nHigh satisfaction rates show that both clinicians and families want more flexible, accessible assessment options.\n\n## Future Direction Alignment\n\nVEDA's development trajectory points toward exactly the kind of revolutionary changes that Enlitens is pioneering.\n\nThe rationale for using this evidence: This document provides institutional validation that the assessment field is evolving toward the approaches that Enlitens has been advocating, giving us credibility and supporting our argument that traditional methods are becoming obsolete.\n\nThis presentation demonstrates that even within traditional medical systems, there is recognition that clinical interview approaches, flexible observation methods, and telehealth delivery can achieve superior outcomes compared to conventional standardized testing batteries. It provides institutional validation for the core principles underlying Enlitens' revolutionary assessment model while showing that our approach represents the next logical step in assessment evolution.",

It provides the core theoretical and philosophical foundation for Enlitens' entire mission. The text argues that human conceptual systems, and therefore our understanding of reality, are fundamentally metaphorical, directly challenging the \"myth of objectivism\" that underpins the validity of standardized testing. It provides the language and arguments to dismantle the idea of a single, objective \"normal\" and replaces it with an \"experientialist\" framework where understanding arises from lived, embodied experience-perfectly aligning with Enlitens' strengths-based, neurodiversity-affirming clinical interview model.\n\n## FILENAME\n\nLAKOFF\\_JOHNSON\\_1980\\_MetaphorsWeLiveBy\\_notes\\_on\\_critique\\_of\\_objectivism\\_and\\_meta phorical\\_reality.pdf\n\n## METADATA\n\n- Primary Category : THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\n- Relevance : Core\n- Document Type : philosophical\\_critique, book\\_notes\n- Key Topics : objectivism, subjectivism, experientialism, metaphor, conceptual systems, truth, categorization, reality construction\n- Tags : #philosophy\\_of\\_science, #epistemology, #metaphor, #objectivity, #standardized\\_testing\\_critique, #neurodiversity, #conceptual\\_systems, #truth, #experientialism\n\n## CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS\n\n- \"Vores almindelige konceptuelle systems natur er fundamentalt metaforisk.\"\n- \"Vores koncepter strukturerer hvad vi perciperer, hvordan vi bev\u00e6ger os rundt i verden, og hvordan vi forholder os til andre.

Metaphor is therefore imaginative rationality.\"\n- \"Metafor forener fornuft og fantasi. Metafor er alts\u00e5 imaginativ rationalitet.\"\n\n## THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n## The Centrality of Metaphor in Defining Reality\n\n- Our conceptual system is fundamentally metaphorical : Vores almindelige konceptuelle systems natur er fundamentalt metaforisk.\n- The essence of metaphor : \"The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another.\"\n- Concepts structure our reality : Vores koncepter strukturerer hvad vi perciperer, hvordan vi bev\u00e6ger os rundt i verden, og hvordan vi forholder os til andre. Det konceptuelle system spiller derfor en central rolle mht. at definere vores hverdags realiteter.\n- Partial, not total, structuring : Metaforisk strukturering er partiel, ikke total (s\u00e5 ville et koncept v\u00e6re et andet koncept, og ikke blot forst\u00e5et gnm. det andet).\n- Hiding and Highlighting : Den systemacitet, som er foruds\u00e6tningen for at vi kan forst\u00e5 et aspekt gnm. et andet, gemmer \"hide\" andre aspekter af konceptet. Pga. ARGUMENT IS WAR overser vi argumentationens kooperative natur.\n- Cultural Coherence : En kulturs mest fundamentale v\u00e6rdier er koherente med dens fundamentale koncepters metaforiske struktur. Vores v\u00e6rdier er alts\u00e5 ikke uafh\u00e6ngige men m\u00e5 indg\u00e5 i et koherent system sammen med de metaforiske koncepter \"we live by\".\n- Experiential Basis : en metafor tjener kun som vehikel for forst\u00e5else af et koncept pga. dets erfaringsm\u00e6ssige basis (experential basis). Reelt kan ingen metafor forst\u00e5s eller ad\u00e6kvat representeres uden dens erfarinsgm\u00e6ssige basis.\n\n## The Myth of Objectivism (A Direct Critique of Standardized Testing's Foundation)\n\n- The cultural choice presented : Misforst\u00e5et kulturel antagelse af at det eneste alternativ til objektivisme er subjektivisme. L&amp;J ser sig selv som givende en tredie mulighed.\n- Verden er bygget op af objekter. De har egenskaber uafh\u00e6ngigt af msk. eller andre v\u00e6sener som oplever dem.\n- The Myth of Objectivism tenets :\n- Vi f\u00e5r vores viden om verden ved at opleve objekterne i den og ved at l\u00e6re hvilke egenskaber objekterne har og hvordan de er relateret til hinanden.\n- Der finde en objektiv virkelighed, og vi kan sige ting der er objektive, absolutte og ubetinget sande eller falske om den.\n- Vi forst\u00e5r objekterne gennem kategorier og begreber.\n- Ord har faste betydninger.\n- Metafor og andre slags poetisk, smart, retorisk eller figurativt sprog kan altid undg\u00e5es ved at tale objektivt.\n- Folk kan v\u00e6re objektive og tale objektivt, men kun hvis de bruger klart defineret sprog, som er ligefremt og direkte og som kan passe p\u00e5 virkeligheden.\n- At v\u00e6re objektiv er generalt en god ting. Kun objektiv viden er egentlig viden.\n- Subjektivitet kan v\u00e6re farligt, eftersom det kan f\u00f8re til at miste kontakten med virkeligheden.\n- At v\u00e6re objektiv er at v\u00e6re rationel.\n- How Objectivism views meaning :\n- Meaning is Disembodied : Objektiv betydning er ikke betydning for nogen. Udtryk i et naturligt sprog kan kun siges at have objektiv mening hvis meningen er uafh\u00e6ngig af hvad msk. g\u00f8r.\n- Meaning is Objective : S\u00e6tningen har den samme objektive mening ligegyldigt om den er sagt af et msk. eller en Papeg\u00f8je. Og det er sandt hvis det tilf\u00e6ldigvis regner og falsk hvis det ikke g\u00f8r. Generelt er objektivistens syn p\u00e5 forst\u00e5else alts\u00e5 begr\u00e6nset til omst\u00e6ndigheder for sandt eller falsk.\n- The Building Block Theory : Hvis verden er opbygget af veldefinerede objekter (og deres iboende egenskaber), kan vi give dem navne i et sprog. Derfor kan vi konstruere et sprog der passer pr\u00e6cis p\u00e5 enhver situation i verden.\n- Consequences of Objectivism for Metaphor : Der findes ikke metaforiske begreber eller betydning. Metafor er kun et sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l om sprog. Ingen bogstavelig (konventionel) metafor. M. kan kun bidrage til forst\u00e5else ved at f\u00e5 os til at se objektive ligheder.\n\n## The Experientialist Alternative: The Foundation for the Enlitens Approach\n\n- The Third Choice : Afviser objektivistisk ide om at der er absolut sandhed, uden at tage subjektivismens ide om at sandhed kun kan n\u00e5es gennem fantasien. The Third Choice: An Experientialist Synthesis.\n- Truth is Relative but Grounded : Sandhed er relativ til forst\u00e5else, der er derfor intet punkt hvorfra man kan se den absolutte sandhed. Det betyder ikke et der ikke findes sandheder, men bare at de er relative til vores konceptuelle system (igen igen), som er forankret (grounded) i, og konstant testet af, vores erfaringer og andre medlemmer af vores kulturs erfaringer i vores daglige inteaktioner med andre msk. og vores fysiske og kulturelle milj\u00f8.\n- Unites Reason and Imagination : Metafor forener fornuft og fantasi. Metafor er alts\u00e5 imaginativ rationalitet.\n- Interaction is Key : Det b\u00e5de objektivismen og subjektivismen mangler er at vi forst\u00e5r verden gennem vores interaktionerne med den. Experientalisme: Msk. del af sine omgivelser. Du kan ikke fungere i omgivelserne uden at \u00e6ndre det eller blive \u00e6ndret af det.\n1. Naturen af vores kroppe og vores fysiske og kulturelle milj\u00f8 p\u00e5l\u00e6gger os vores erfaring en struktur.\n- How Understanding Emerges (The Experientialist Model) :\n2. Tilbagevendende erfaring leder til formation af kategorier, som er experiential gestalter. S\u00e5danne gestalter definerer sammenh\u00e6ng i vores erfaring.\n4. Vi forst\u00e5r erfaring metaforisk n\u00e5r vi bruger en gestalt fra et omr\u00e5de til at strukturere erfaring i et andet.\n3. Vi forst\u00e5r vores erfaring direkte n\u00e5r vi opfatter den som struktureret sammenh\u00e6ngende via gestalter som er opst\u00e5et af vores interaktion med og i vores omgivelser.\n\n## Truth, Power, and Categorization\n\n- Truth is Based on Understanding : Truth Is Based on Understanding. Det er fordi vi forst\u00e5r situationer pba vores konceptuelle system, at vi kan forst\u00e5 udsagn der bruger det system af begreber som v\u00e6rende sande. Dvs. s\u00e5 passende eller ikke-passende p\u00e5 situationen som vi forst\u00e5r den. We understand a statement as being true in a given situation when our understanding of the statement fits our understanding of the situation closely enough for our purposes.\n- Power and Metaphor : People in power get to impose their metaphors. Accepten af metaforen tvinger os til at fokusere p\u00e5 de aspekter af vores erfaring/oplevelse som den fremh\u00e6ver og leder os til at se det den medf\u00f8rer (entailments) som sandt.\n- The Danger of \"Objective Truth\" : Mener at ideen om at der er en absolut sandhed ikke er alene er forkert, men ogs\u00e5 socialt og politisk farlig.\n- Critique of Classical Categorization :\n- Experientialist view : Denne opfattelse passer ikke med den m\u00e5de folk kategoriserer ting og erfaringer. For mennesker er kategorisering prim\u00e6rt et middel til at forst\u00e5 verden. Istedet defineret vha prototyper og typer af relationer til prototyper.\n- Objectivist view : En kategori er defineret vha. en r\u00e6kke iboende egenskaber af enhederne i kategorien. Alt i universet er enten udenfor eller indenfor kategorien.\n- Properties are Interactional, Not Inherent : Standard synspuntet pr\u00f8ver at v\u00e6re objektivt. Det antager at erfaringer og objekter har iboende ejendele (properties) og at mennesker udelukkende forst\u00e5r dem gennem disse ejendele. Modsat mener L&amp;K at vi kun delvist forst\u00e5r 'love' ved hj\u00e6lp af s\u00e5danne iboende ejendele.\n- For st\u00f8rstedelen er vores forst\u00e5else af 'love' metaforisk. Begreber er ikke udelukkende defineret ved iboende egenskaber - de er prim\u00e6rt defineret ved interaktive egenskaber.\n\n## The Inadequacy of Abstraction and Homonymy Theories (Alternative Explanations that Uphold Objectivism)\n\n- Abstraction Theory Inadequacies : This theory claims that words like \"buttress\" in \"he buttressed his argument\" and \"he buttressed the wall\" are just specific instances of a single abstract concept of \"buttressing.\" L&amp;J argue this is inadequate because:\n2. It cannot explain the asymmetry of metaphors (we understand ARGUMENT in terms of WAR, but not WAR in terms of ARGUMENT).\n1. It cannot explain orientational metaphors (e.g., what single abstract concept could unite HAPPY IS UP and MORE IS UP?).\n3. It fails to explain the systematicity of metaphorical concepts.\n- Homonymy Theory Inadequacies : This theory claims that the two uses of \"attack\" (in war and in argument) are just two different, unrelated concepts that happen to use the same word. L&amp;J argue this is inadequate because:\n4. It assumes the concept being explained (e.g., LOVE) has a pre-existing, independent structure, when L&amp;J's point is that it gets its structure from the metaphor.\n1. It cannot account for the systematic relationships between metaphorical concepts.\n3. L&amp;J's theory is predictive (based on experiential correlations), while the similarity theory is only an \"after the fact\" explanation.\n2. The \"weak\" version relies on \"similarity,\" but L&amp;J argue there is no objective, inherent similarity to be found (what is the inherent similarity between VIRTUE and MORE?). Instead, metaphor creates similarity.",

MCAS is a common, yet rarely diagnosed, inflammatory, and immunologic disease characterized by mast cell dysregulation. Methods: Questionnaires from 553 MCAS and 558 control subjects determined the prevalence and odds ratio of neurologic  disorders  (fatigue,  cognitive  dysfunction,  fainting/near  fainting,  migraine-like  headaches,  muscle pain/tenderness/weakness, pain/numbness/tingling in extremities, restless legs syndrome, seizure-like activity, insomnia,  sleep  attacks,  tinnitus,  acoustic  startle,  Tourette ' s  syndrome,  resting  tremor,  and  light/sun/pain/ odors/scents/noise hypersensitivity) and psychiatric disorders (anxiety, agoraphobia, panic attacks, depression, bipolar depression, mania/hypomania, psychosis/schizophrenia, hallucinations, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder, anger management problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal thoughts, and eating disorders).\n\nResults: Among 19 neurologic disorders, female MCAS patients reported higher rates in all but 1 disorder and male MCAS patients reported higher rates in all but 2 disorders. Among 14 psychiatric disorders, female MCAS patients reported higher rates in all and male MCAS patients reported higher rates in 8 disorders. Many of the disorders with increased prevalences were statistically greater compared to corresponding controls.\n\nIn self-reported ratings for effects on health status (0 = no benefit, 10 = maximum benefit), mean (SD) response was 6.3 (2.5) for antihistamines, 5.6 (3.2) for low-dose naltrexone, and 5.6 (3.1) for benzodiazepines.\n\nConclusion: MCAS subjects have significantly elevated odds ratios for many neuropsychiatric disorders and may see improvement of symptoms using MCAS-targeted therapies, suggesting that mast cell dysregulation affects the brain and peripheral nervous systems and contributes to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Certain mast cell mediators, specific genetic predisposition, and life experiences could determine which disorder is apt to develop or worsen.\n\nAbbreviations: BBB, blood-brain barrier; FMS, fibromyalgia syndrome; LDN, low-dose naltrexone; MCAD, mast cell activation disease; MCAS, mast cell activation syndrome; MC, mast cell; MCs, mast cells; MCMRS, mast cell mediator release syndrome; NP, neuropsychiatric; POTS, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; RLS, restless legs syndrome; SM, systemic mastocytosis.\n\n* Corresponding author.\n\nE-mail addresses: lw@gidoctor.net (L.B.

Introduction\n\n## 1.1. Overview of treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders\n\nThe clinical and societal impacts of neuropsychiatric (NP) disorders are profound, affecting countless individuals and families (Hill et al., 2021; Barr et al., 2022). Therefore, it is crucial to pursue treatments that specifically target the underlying pathophysiology. The impact of NP disorders is especially substantial for migraines, cognitive dysfunction, autism, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and depression (Burch et al., 2018; Hale et al., 2020; Theoharides et al., 2012a,b,c-a; Allen et al., 2005; Barr et  al.,  2022).  These  disorders  and  others  have  been  associated  with neuroimmune dysfunction and can be difficult to treat (Liberman et al., 2018).\n\n## 1.2. Multisystemic presentations of mast cell activation syndrome\n\nMast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) remains unrecognized as the primary cause for many complex patients with a multisystemic disorder (Afrin et al., 2016-a; Afrin et al., 2016-b; Afrin et al., 2020a,b). Symptoms of MCAS typically begin during childhood, sometimes in infancy (Afrin et al., 2020a,b). Patients may experience a variety of non-specific gastrointestinal and dermatologic symptoms, headaches, and frequent episodes of inflammation, which may be misinterpreted as infections. Other issues can include developmental anomalies, problems with the integrity  and  healing  of  connective  tissues,  and  atopic  disorders. MCAS-associated NP manifestations can be caused by dysfunction of the abnormal  MCs  in  the  central  and/or  peripheral  nervous  system  or indirectly by MC mediators in other tissues which lead to inflammatory and other effects in nervous systems (Afrin et al., 2015). For instance, cytokines  such  as  IL-12,  a  key  mediator  of  neuroinflammation,  may contribute to NP symptoms by altering neurotransmitter systems and activating microglia (Chauhan et al., 2025). While NP manifestations have been reported in systemic mastocytosis (SM), a rare malignancy, MCAS itself has only recently gained attention, making it an underappreciated and often treatable differential diagnosis to explain a wide range of NP disorders (Sag\u00fces-Ses \u00b4 e et al., 2023; Afrin et al., 2015). Many NP disorders may stem from this more prevalent MC disease. Inflammatory disorders are often more prominent than allergic phenomena. Although allergic, dystrophic, and other phenomena are commonly seen in MCAS, chronic multisystem inflammation is the universal constant, or sine qua non, of MCAS (Afrin et al., 2016-a). Concordant with the MC ' s evolutionarily defined role as the immune system ' s front-line sentinel against insults to the body, a very wide range of stimuli for triggering MC activation has been identified, including a vast array of physical substances and forces (Weinstock et al., 2024). Mast cell activation and NP symptoms are known to be worsened by stress in humans and in lab animals (Theoharides, 2000; Sanacora et al., 2022). Thus, in MCAS there is  not  only  constitutive  chronic  aberrant  mediator  release  by  the dysfunctional  MCs  but  also  inappropriate  reactive  mediator  release upon exposure to various triggers.\n\nThe diagnosis of MCAS is often delayed for decades. Reasons for this include: 1) the relative absence of MCAS education in medical school and residency curricula, 2) the common misconception that an increased serum tryptase level is needed to establish the diagnosis, and 3) the marked  heterogeneity  of  the  disease ' s  clinical  presentation  (consequential to its marked heterogeneity at the genetic mutation level and the mediator expression level).\n\nOne  should  consider  a  differential  diagnosis  to  include  systemic mastocytosis and subclassifications, monoclonal MCAS, and secondary MCAS. As is the case with most challenges in differential diagnosis, it is the totality of the patient ' s presentation (the symptoms and problems experienced throughout the patient ' s life, and the full extent of findings on  comprehensive  physical  examination  and  thorough  laboratory testing  including  properly  technically  executed  testing  looking  for elevated levels in blood or urine of mediators relatively specific to the mast cell) which fairly reliably reveals the patients in whom MCAS is most  likely  underlying/unifying  diagnosis  accounting  for  the  largest extent of the problems and findings in the patient to date.\n\n## 1.3. Etiology and prevalence of mast cell activation syndrome\n\nMast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is characterized by unregulated immune responses often linked to genetic mutations in mast cell (MC) regulatory genes (Molderings et al., 2007, Afrin et al., 2016a; Afrin et al., 2017; Afrin et al., 2020a,b). Epigenetic changes leading to somatic variants in MC regulatory genes are usually at the root of this lifelong illness (Molderings, 2007, 2022). Such variants and consequential MC dysfunction usually begin early in an MCAS patient ' s life. As most MCAS patients progress through life, the acquisition of other variants (typically soon after major stressors) often leads the disease to escalate its baseline level of MC dysfunction, potentially affecting any or every system in the body (Afrin et al., 2020a,b).\n\nMCAS  is  diagnosed  far  more  commonly  in  females  than  males (~4 -5:1),  which  may  be  due  to  biological  determinants  (e.g.,  MCsurface  estrogen  receptors)  (Zierau  et  al.,  2012).  The  prevalence  of MCAS in the Northern Hemisphere is estimated at 4 % -17 % (Zaghmout et al., 2024; Molderings et al., 2013).\n\nThe biology and anatomical distribution of MCs in proximity to peripheral and central neurons may account for a wide range of extensive NP symptoms seen in these patients (Theoharides et al., 2024). Hundreds of mediators and cell-surface receptors are known to be expressed by mast cells (MCs) (Molderings, Afrin, 2023). In the largest series of prospective  MCAS patients (N = 413),  the  prevalence  of  various  NP disorders and symptoms included fatigue (83 %), fibromyalgia-type pain (75  %),  pre-syncope/syncope  (71  %),  headaches  (63  %),  cognitive dysfunction  (49  %),  insomnia  (35  %),  vision  abnormalities  (30  %), anxiety and/or panic attacks (16 %), depression (13 %) and involuntary movements (13 %) (Afrin et al., 2017). In 2010, an article listed headache,  syncope,  and  psychiatric  conditions  that  were  associated  with mast cell activation (Akin et al., 2010).\n\n## 1.4. The brain, mast cells, mediators, and inflammation\n\nMCAS-associated NP manifestations can be caused by dysfunction of abnormal  MCs  in  the  central  and/or  peripheral  nervous  system  or indirectly by MC mediators in other tissues, leading to inflammatory and other  effects  in  the  peripheral  and  central  nervous  systems  (CNS) (Theoharides et al., 2012a,b,c-b; Theoharides et al., 2016, 2017, 2019, 2024). Migraine is a common comorbidity noted in patients with MCAS (Blitshteyn, 2023). MCs are present in the meninges and are implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine via neuropeptide release, vasodilation, plasma, and protein extravasation that can lead to MC degranulation (Hendriksen et al., 2017). Degranulation of meningeal MCs may sensitize trigeminal vascular afferent processing (Blitshteyn, 2023). This MC-mediated pathway is thought to be one of the mechanisms underlying migraine pain pathophysiology (Aich et al., 2015). Additionally, circulating autoantibodies could affect the brain and autonomic nervous system due to an MC-induced hyperpermeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or  an  abnormal  functioning  blood-cerebrospinal  fluid  barrier (Shelestak et al., 2020; Gelb, 2018). The role of MC activation in a variety of NP disorders has been studied in humans and in animal models (Theoharides et al., 2016; Moura et al., 2011; Georgin-Lavialle et al., 2016; Kempuraj et al., 2017; Nicoloro-SantaBarbara et al., 2021; Nicoloro-SantaBarbara et al., 2022; Jendoubi et al., 2021; Bidri et al., 1999; Ikarashi,  Yuzurihara,  2002).  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  has demonstrated morphological and functional abnormalities in the brains of SM patients with NP complaints, (Boddaert et al., 2017). MCAS patients with NP complaints also have similar neuro-radiographic findings (abnormal punctuated white matter abnormalities) (Haenisch, Molderings, 2018).\n\nL.B. Weinstock et al.\n\n## 1.5. Inflammation, allergy, and psychiatric disorders\n\nThe field of immuno-psychiatry has been suggested as an agenda for clinicians to develop innovative research (Leboyer et al., 2016). Immune and/or inflammatory disorders have been suspected to play direct roles in  the  pathophysiology  of  the  following  disorders:  pediatric  autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders  associated  with  depression,  streptococcal  infection,  pediatric  acute-onset  neuropsychiatric  syndrome, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and tic disorders (Leonard et al., 2001; Hamdani et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2015; Gerentes et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2021; Marazziti et al., 2023). In an exceptionally large pediatric study of tic disorders (N = 4508), ADHD (N = 83,569), and/or OCD (N = 1555), there was a higher prevalence of atopy in tic disorders (51.6 %), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (50.7 %), and OCD (47.7 %) compared to 75,000 controls (38.6 %)  (Hakimi  et  al.,  2022).  The  prevalence  of  allergic  conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis was higher in children with tics, ADHD, or OCD as compared to controls.\n\n## 1.6. Mast cell therapy and improvement in neuropsychiatric manifestations\n\nThere is emerging evidence that MC therapy may be effective for NP disorders in patients with MCAD. Antihistamines have been recognized to be helpful in some NP disorders, including migraine and neuropathic pain (Worm et al., 2019; Khalilzadeh et al., 2018). Omalizumab was partially  effective  for several  NP symptoms in SM and MCAS (Lemal et al., 2019). In MCAS, NP symptoms improved in a patient with severe MCAS  and  postural  orthostatic  tachycardia  syndrome  (POTS)  using low-dose  naltrexone  (LDN),  intravenous  immune  globulin,  and  antibiotic  therapy  for  small  intestinal  bacterial  overgrowth  (Weinstock et  al.,  2018).  A  case  series  of  116  MCAS  patients  treated  with  LDN demonstrated improvement in a wide array of NP disorders (Weinstock, 2020-a). In another case series, combinations of antihistamines, LDN, and other MC medications were successful in treating standard-treatment  refractory  NP  manifestations  (Weinstock  et  al., 2023). An animal study showed overall improvement in hippocampal neuroinflammation, apoptosis and synapse dysfunction using zileuton (a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor occasionally used in MCAD) (Liu et al., 2020). Several patients who were first evaluated by the authors noted that chronic benzodiazepines appear to have had been prescribed by other doctors for anxiety and insomnia. These two conditions were the most common NP disorders seen in MCAS patients (Afrin et al., 2017). In the authors ' experience, benzodiazepines, typically at low, non-addicting doses and principally via their engagement with inhibitory benzodiazepine binding targets known to be present in MCs, not uncommonly help diverse MCAS symptoms including a variety of NP and  systemic  symptoms,  not  only  when  taken  reactively  during  a trigger-induced symptomatic flaring of the disease but also when taken preventively at a low dose. An intravenous protocol that includes lorazepam  appeared  to help MCAS-induced  gastrointestinal attacks (Weinstock et al., 2024). In vitro studies showed that benzodiazepines reduce MC activity (Birdri et al., 1999; Hoffmann et al., 2013; Yousefi et  al.,  2013;  Haenisch  et  al.,  2013).  Luteolin,  a  flavonoid  with anti-inflammatory efficacy, is used to treat MCAS as a MC stabilizer but has also been shown to improve autism spectrum disease, fatigue, and cognitive  dysfunction  (Theoharides  et  al.,  2012a,b,c-c;  Theoharides et al., 2012a,b,c; Tsilioni I, Theoharides, 2024; Gelabert-Rebato et al., 2019). Vitamin D is another MC stabilizer and is also protective against NP disorders (Wassif et al., 2023). Certain probiotics and herbal medications can also suppress MC-induced inflammation (Dev et al., 2008; Li et al., 2019).\n\n## 1.7. Purpose of this study\n\nThe study sought to determine the prevalence of a variety of NP\n\nmanifestations  in  MCAS  patients  in  comparison  to  healthy  controls. Chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, faint/near faint, migraine-like headaches,  muscle  pain/tenderness,  muscle  weakness  in  the  arms/ legs, nerve pain/numbness/tingling, RLS, seizure-like activity, insomnia, sleep attacks, tinnitus, acoustic startle, Tourette ' s syndrome, resting  tremors,  and  hypersensitivity  to  (a)  light/sun,  (b)  pain,  (c) odors/scents, or (d) noise were studied. Participants with MCAS were evaluated retrospectively for the historical efficacy and side effects of MC therapy by antihistamines, LDN, and benzodiazepines.\n\n## 2. Methods\n\n## 2.1. Study approval\n\nThe study was reviewed by the Sterling Investigational Review Board in Atlanta, Georgia. The board determined that the study (ID #12217, Protocol #12212) was exempt from full review pursuant to the terms of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service ' s Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.104(d). The board determined  that  the  exemption  Category  2  applied.  All  participants signed an electronic informed consent form that allowed anonymous collection and reporting of clinical data.\n\n## 2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nMCAS subjects were included if they were previously diagnosed with MCAS by one of the investigators using either the consensus-1 and/or consensus-2  proposals  for  diagnostic  criteria  for  MCAS  (Afrin  et  al., 2020a). Consensus-1 and -2 criteria include 2 or more systems with MC symptoms,  although  anaphylaxis  is  usually  present  in  consensus-1. Laboratory support for a diagnosis of MCAS per consensus-1 requires an increase of tryptase during a MC attack, whereas any increase of tryptase  (not  attributable  to  hereditary  alpha-tryptasemia)  or  other mediators  relatively  specific  to  the  mast  cell  supports  a  diagnosis  of MCAS per consensus-2. The third criteria are similar in both consensus groups  (required  in  consensus-1,  though  optional  in  consensus-2  in recognition of the disease ' s heterogeneity) -namely, that MC directed therapy improves the symptoms.\n\nThe study was a multicenter study with participants recruited from practices  based  in  Missouri,  New  York,  Washington,  and  Colorado. These clinicians had expertise in MCAS with specialties in gastroenterology (LW), hematology/oncology (LA), neurology (SB, LK), and internal medicine with a focus on complex diseases (GE, JS, TD, DK).\n\nControl subjects  were  included  if  they  had  never  been  diagnosed with  MCAS.  Owing  to  the  high  prevalence  of  MCAS  in  the  general population and significant genetic predisposition, it is possible that some of the controls had undiagnosed MCAS. All participants were asked if there was a personal or family history of anaphylaxis, atopic disorders ( ' severe  allergic  symptoms  and/or  asthma  requiring  medicines  on  a weekly  basis  year-round ' ),  chronic  fatigue  syndrome  (CFS),  chronic pelvic  pain  syndromes  (CPPS  including  interstitial  cystitis,  chronic prostatitis, and vulvodynia), chronic vomiting syndrome (CVS), EhlersDanlos syndrome (EDS), fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS),  postural  orthostatic  tachycardia  syndrome  (POTS), RLS, or urticaria.\n\nAll participants had the same exclusion criteria: age less than 18 or greater than 85, and inability to read English at 8th grade level or above. Subjects  were  also  excluded  if  they  were  receiving  chemotherapy, currently  pregnant,  or  infected  with  mononucleosis  which  could  all cause MCAS symptoms. Vulnerable populations were excluded.\n\n## 2.3. Study design and methods\n\nReview of patient records  to confirm  the  diagnosis  of  MCAS  was performed by each investigator. These patients received invitations to join the study by each investigator. The invitation stated that patients\n\nL.B. Weinstock et al.\n\nwere being recruited to compare symptoms and conditions of MCAS versus a healthy population and that the survey was anonymous. The patients and investigators were asked to recruit their own healthy social network to the control group. The study design was observational and included retrospective and current data. To access the online questionnaire,  the  consent  form  was  reviewed  and  affirmed  before  survey questions  could  be  reviewed.  Survey  responses  from  subjects  who completed less than 85 % of the survey were excluded from analysis. When disorders were not well known by their common name such as depression or anxiety, a lay definition was provided. Neurologic examples include brain fog (disturbance of memory, word-finding difficulties, difficulties  in  concentrating),  acoustic  startle  (muscular  activity  in response to a sudden loud sound), restless legs syndrome (the compelling urge to move one ' s legs or arms while at rest, often associated with discomfort,  usually  at  night  and  at  rest,  temporarily  improves  with movement; it is not muscular cramps or caused by pain in the back), and tinnitus (ringing or other noises in the ear(s) are bothersome and not caused by loud noise injury and do not sound like pulsations). A psychiatric  example  included  agoraphobia:  fear  and  avoiding  places  or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless, or  embarrassed).  See  Appendix  1 for  other  questionnaire  details.  In contrast, a variety of medical terms are used in this text in response to the answers. For example, the question on the survey was ' do you have pain, tingling, and/or numbness in the legs or arms, ' while in this text we use the medical term neuropathy.\n\nThe  MC  mediator  release  syndrome  (MCMRS)  questionnaire  was used as a template for part of the health survey. The MCMRS score is a standardized validated checklist (Appendix 2) (Molderings et al., 2013). The  updated  MCMRS  includes  severity  scores  which  were  used  to calculate the cumulative severity score (Weinstock et al., 2020-b).\n\n## 2.4. Analysis of study results\n\nData  included  subject  age,  gender,  ethnicity,  and  comparison  of personal and familial health disorders. The primary outcome was the prevalence of NP disorders in MCAS subjects compared to controls. The control  group  with  and  without  MCAS  risk  factors  were  compared separately to the MCAS group.\n\nTo evaluate fatigue, subjects were asked to think back to the worst part of their lifetime regarding fatigue and/or weakness and use the following scales to rate the symptoms: 1) frequency: 0 = none of the time; 1 = a little of the time; 2 = about half of the time; 3 = most of the  time;  4 = all  of  the  time;  and  2)  severity:  0 = symptom not present; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe. The worst possible score is 8 points.\n\nThe  DePaul  Symptom  Questionnaire  was  used  to  assess  postexertional malaise (Cotler et al., 2018) with 5 questions based on the presence  or  absence  of  five  symptoms:  1)  dead,  heavy  feeling  after starting to exercise?; 2) next day soreness or fatigue after non-strenuous, everyday  activities?;  3)  mentally  tired  after  the  slightest  effort?;  4) minimum  exercise  makes  you  physically  tired?;  and  5)  physically drained or sick after mild activity? The worst possible score is 5 points.\n\nThe prevalence of depression was determined by asking if there was a physician ' s diagnosis and/or self-diagnosis of depression independent of a consequence of complications of COVID Infection. Subjects were asked: 1) if they ever had a period of depressed mood lasting most of the day almost every day for a period of at least 2 weeks; 2) if they ever had a period of at least 2 weeks in which they were much less interested in the things they usually liked to do; 3) if they ever felt deeply sad for 2 or more weeks; and 4) if they ever felt suicidal. To look for confounding causes of depression or anxiety, subjects were asked if they ever experienced abuse, trauma, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their lifetime.\n\nParticipants with MCAS were asked to record the historical efficacy and side effects of MC  therapy by antihistamines, LDN, and benzodiazepines. Each medicine was evaluated by the percentage of the MCAS subjects who were using such medications presently or had used them in the past. Global health improvement using a Likert scale with mean ( \u00b1 SD) degree of improvement was based on a Likert scale of 0 (no improvement) to 10 (excellent improvement). Participants with MCAS also marked which NP symptoms improved to any degree, if any, by each medication.\n\n## 2.5. Statistical methods\n\nDescriptive  statistics  included  measures  of  central  tendency  and variability  for  continuous  variables,  and  percentages  for  categorical variables. Welch ' s t-tests and Chi-square tests were used to test significant differences between patients and controls on continuous and categorical  variables,  respectively.  To  compare  the  prevalence  of  NP disorders between MCAS patients and the non-age-matched controls, we performed logistic regression analyses for each disorder, separately for males and females. In each model, the presence of the NP condition (present vs. absent) was regressed on MCAS status (MCAS vs. control) while adjusting for age as a covariate. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence  intervals  (CI)  were  then  computed  from  the  regression  coefficients  to  quantify  the  association  between  MCAS  and  each  NP condition. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.41 (R Core Team, 2024). Statistical significance was defined as p &lt; .05.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n## 3.1. Clinical characteristics of subjects\n\n553 MCAS patients and 558 controls completed the survey. Patients included 499 females with mean age \u00b1 SD 45.9 \u00b1 14.3 and 54 males with mean age 46.6 \u00b1 15.5. Controls included 416 females with mean age 51.8 \u00b1 15.0 and 142 males with mean age 54.1 \u00b1 16.1. Among both genders, patients were significantly younger than controls (females p &lt; .0001 and males p = .0036). Table 1 shows the demographics of the participants which were similar. The MCAS patients ' mean time from diagnosis of MCAS to the time of the survey was 3.0 \u00b1 2.5 years for females and 4.3 \u00b1 2.6 years for males.\n\nDespite their younger age, patients had accumulated all clinical risk factors compared to controls, as shown in Table 2. Patients reported significantly higher rates of MCAS-related diagnoses and family history of the diagnoses. The most common physician-diagnosed comorbid diagnoses were POTS, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and urticaria.

As shown in Table 3, patients had significantly higher overall MCMRS scores, more symptoms (i.e., symptom count), more systems involved (i.e., system count), and higher symptom severity scores compared to their same-gender controls. Spider web plots representing total MCMRS scores and system involvement in MCAS patients and control subjects are shown in Fig. 1.\n\n## 3.2. Prevalence of neurologic disorders and symptoms\n\nFemale  patients  had  a  mean \u00b1 SD  of  10.0 \u00b1 4.0  self-reported neurologic  disorders  and  symptoms,  significantly  higher  than  female controls (mean 2.5 \u00b1 3.3, p &lt; .001). Male patients had a mean of 7.0 \u00b1 4.2  self-reported  neurologic  disorders  and  symptoms,  significantly higher than male controls (mean 0.5 \u00b1 2.5, p &lt; .001).

The most prevalent were fatigue, cognitive  dysfunction, neuropathy, and migraines, with female patients ' prevalence exceeding 70 % and male patients trailing closely behind. To better characterize the major differences in prevalences between patients and controls, female and male MCAS patients ' OR for each disorder were calculated, controlling for age and gender. This allowed us to quantify how MCAS was associated with (often dramatically) increased odds of having each disorder relative to the baseline rates in our control group. Female patients ' OR were highest at 23.5 for cognitive dysfunction, 22.3 for fatigue, and 15.3 for non-epileptic seizure activity. Male MCAS patients ' OR were highest at 28.0 for odor sensitivity, 23.4 for light sensitivity, and 18.6 for fatigue. In other words, MCAS patients were dramatically more  likely  to  report  many  neurologic  disorders,  suggesting  the observed  difference  between  patients  and  controls  was  not  due  to chance.\n\n## 3.3. Prevalence of psychiatric disorders and symptoms\n\nTables 5a and 5b illustrate self-reported prevalence of each psychiatric disorder and symptom by group and gender. The most prevalent symptoms were anxiety disorder, depression, panic attacks, and PTSD where female patients ' prevalence neared (or exceeded) 50 % and male patients trailed but still showed high prevalence compared to controls. Female patients had a mean of 3.8 \u00b1 2.6 self-reported psychiatric disorders, significantly higher than female controls (mean 1.3 \u00b1 1.8, p &lt; .001). Male patients had a mean of 2.9 \u00b1 2.7 self-reported psychiatric disorders, significantly higher than male controls (mean 0.9 \u00b1 1.7, p &lt; .001).\n\nTo better characterize the significant differences in prevalences between patients and controls, the OR was calculated for each symptom, separately for males and females, and controlled for age. Female patients ' OR were statistically significantly higher than female controls on 13 of 14 disorders, and highest at OR 12.3 for hallucinations, 8.1 for bipolar depression, 7.4 for suicidal ideation, 6.6 for PTSD and 6.1 for OCD. Male patients ' OR were statistically significantly higher than male controls on 8 of 14 disorders, and highest at OR 8.3 for PTSD, 8.0 for OCD, 8.3, 7.9 for agoraphobia, and 7.0 for hallucinations.\n\n## 3.4. Response to medical therapy for both neurologic and psychiatric disorders and symptoms\n\nThe number and percent of MCAS subjects who tried antihistamines was 498 (88.9 %), LDN was 347 (62.0 %), and benzodiazepines was 324 (57. 9 %). In self-reported ratings for effects on health status (0 = no benefit,  10 = maximum  conceivable  benefit),  MCAS  patients  gave slightly, but significantly higher mean ratings ( \u00b1 SD) to antihistamines 6.3 ( \u00b1 2.3) vs. LDN 5.6 ( \u00b1 3.2) and benzodiazepines 5.6 ( \u00b1 3.1) (p &lt; .01).\n\nIn the subjects who experienced the following neurologic disorders and symptoms, antihistamines were rated effective by 25 % of the patients  who  used  antihistamines  for  cognitive  dysfunction,  23  %  for migraine, 22 % for fatigue, and 21 % for chronic severe insomnia. LDN\n\nFig. 1. Mast cell mediator release syndrome score spiderweb plots by group and gender.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwas rated to be effective by 29 % for fatigue and myalgia, 28 % for cognitive dysfunction, and 22 % for both neuropathy and RLS. Benzodiazepines helped 51 % of those with chronic severe insomnia, 34 % with tremors at rest, 29 % with RLS, 25 % with pain hypersensitivity, and 22 % with myalgia. Further details are shown in Table 6a.\n\nIn the subjects who experienced the following psychiatric disorders and symptoms, antihistamines were rated effective by 21 % for anxiety disorder, 14 % for anger management problems, 13 % for depression, and 12 % for panic disorder. LDN was rated effective by 16 % for anxiety disorder  and  depression,  14  %  for  bipolar  disorder,  12  %  for  agoraphobia, and 10 % for ADHD. Benzodiazepines showed the highest efficacy ratings for anxiety disorders (helping 70 %), panic disorder (52 %), agoraphobia (51 %), OCD (38 %), PTSD (33 %), and anger management (32 %). Among 324 patients who took benzodiazepines, 76 (23.4 %) had to increase dose to maintain the same effect. Further details are shown in Table 6b. Specific symptoms were summarized in supplemental files 1 to 3.\n\n## 3.5. Side effects of medical therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders\n\nSide effects were reported by patients at a rate of 38.5 % for antihistamines,  33.7  %  for  LDN,  and  34.9  %  for  benzodiazepines,  with further details shown in Table 7. Among 324 patients who took benzodiazepines, 76 (23.4 %) had to increase the dose to maintain the same effect,  yet  specific  data  about  whether  this  drug  class  was  used  as monotherapy was not assessed in the questionnaire. Patients reported a wide range of side effects  to  these  medications,  though  it  is  unclear whether such issues were drug-driven reactivities or, as MCAS is known to drive, excipient-driven reactivities (Schofield, Afrin, 2019).\n\nWell-established  general  physiological  effects  (dryness  of  mucus membranes -12 patients) and neurological and neuropsychiatric effects (fatigue -9 patients) were common for those who tried type-1 antihistamines. The use of sedating versus nonsedating antihistamines was not questioned in the survey (Appendix 1). LDN was associated with a large variety  of  side  effects  including  headaches,  insomnia,  and  abnormal dreams.  The  most  reported  side  effects  from  benzodiazepines  were drowsiness (22 patients), fatigue (19 patients), brain fog (18 patients), and other memory issues (15 patients). Increased anxiety in 10 patients and  worsening  depression  in  8  patients  was  also  reported.  Fourteen patients reported anaphylaxis and hives from benzodiazepines.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\n## 4.1. Overview\n\nThe present study showed that MCAS patients have high rates of selfreported NP disorders and symptoms compared to healthy age-matched controls. For neurologic disorders, the prevalence in descending order from 75 % to 25 % included fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, migrainelike headaches, faint/near faint, insomnia, environmental sensitivities (odor, light,  sound), tinnitus,  muscle  tenderness,  neuropathy-like symptoms, muscle weakness, RLS, pain hypersensitivity, and acoustic startle. For psychiatric disorders, the highest prevalences observed in descending order from 75 % to 25 % included anxiety, depression, panic disorder, PTSD, suicidal thoughts, and OCD.\n\nWe theorize  that,  when  inappropriately  expressed,  MC  mediators which either cross the BBB into the CNS or which are expressed by MCs resident within the CNS can lead to or exacerbate various NP disorders.\n\nTable 4a Female prevalences and odds ratios for neurologic disorders and symptoms.\n\n|                                | Prevalence in female patients   | Prevalence in female controls   | Odds ratio (95 % CI) for female MCAS patients a   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Cognitive dysfunction          | 88.3 %                          | 23.3 %                          | 23.5 (16.6 - 33.7), p < .001                      |\n| Chronic fatigue                | 86.7 %                          | 21.6 %                          | 22.3 (15.9 - 31.9), p < .001                      |\n| Neuropathy                     | 73.1 %                          | 19.5 %                          | 12.1 (8.8 - 16.8), p < .001                       |\n| Migraines or severe headaches  | 70.0 %                          | 27.9 %                          | 5.6 (4.2 - 7.5), p < .001                         |\n| Odor hypersensitivity          | 69.0 %                          | 13.5 %                          | 13.8 (9.9 - 19.6), p < .001                       |\n| Myalgia                        | 68.6 %                          | 14.7 %                          | 13.2 (9.5 - 18.6), p < .001                       |\n| Light hypersensitivity         | 66.3 %                          | 13.5 %                          | 12.5 (8.9 - 17.7), p < .001                       |\n| Tinnitus                       | 59.1 %                          | 17.5 %                          | 7.4 (5.4 - 10.3), p < .001                        |\n| Fainting or near faint         | 59.1 %                          | 10.8 %                          | 11.0 (7.8 - 15.9), p < .001                       |\n| Insomnia (severe and chronic)  | 58.7 %                          | 24.0 %                          | 4.8 (3.6 - 6.4), p < .001                         |\n| Muscle weakness                | 50.3 %                          | 10.3 %                          | 9.4 (6.5 - 13.7), p < .001                        |\n| Sound hypersensitivity         | 47.4 %                          | 11.1 %                          | 6.9 (4.8 - 9.9), p < .001                         |\n| Acoustic startle               | 44.8 %                          | 13.0 %                          | 5.5 (4.0 - 7.8), p < .001                         |\n| Sleep attacks                  | 41.1 %                          | 13.0 %                          | 10.0 (6.6 - 15.8), p < .001                       |\n| Restless legs syndrome         | 37.2 %                          | 11.8 %                          | 4.4 (3.1 - 6.3), p < .001                         |\n| Pain hypersensitivity          | 31.8 %                          | 6.0 %                           | 7.2 (4.7 - 11.6), p < .001                        |\n| Tremors at rest                | 19.1 %                          | 2.2 %                           | 9.9 (5.2 - 21.3), p < .001                        |\n| Non-epileptic seizure activity | 16.4 %                          | 1.2 %                           | 15.3 (6.8 - 44.0), p < .001                       |\n| Tourette ' s syndrome          | 3.1 %                           | 0.0 %                           | N/A b                                             |\n\na CI, Confidence Intervals controlling for age.\n\nb N/A not applicable, due to inability to calculate OR with 0 prevalence for controls.\n\nCertain MC mediators, specific genetic predisposition, and life experiences could determine which disorder is apt to develop or worsen. NP disorders could also be affected by genetically mutated MCs in the CNS and/or peripheral nervous system or by circulating MC mediators that may lead to CNS or peripheral nervous system neuroinflammation.\n\nAlthough  histamine  itself  does  not  readily  cross  the  blood-brain barrier  (BBB)  (Partridge,  2005),  histamine  generated  by  any  cells within the CNS (including at least some neurons as well as MCs, macrophages, and some glial cells) obviously has potential to engage with any cells within the CNS which express histamine receptors. Most of the histamine receptors (H1, H2, and H4 (Haas et al., 2008; Szukiewicz, 2024), found on most MCs are also found on most neurons (evidence is weaker regarding neuronal expression of H4 receptors (Schneider, Seifert,  2016),  so  it  is  inescapable  that  aberrantly  excessive  histamine expression by the fundamentally dysfunctional MCs at the root of MCAS (and regardless of whether such MCs are resident within the CNS or outside) has ample potential to drive a wide array of problems in both peripheral and central neurons both directly via binding with neuronal histamine receptors as well as indirectly by binding with various immune and glial cells in the central nervous system. Depending on which mediators  are  (directly  and/or  indirectly)  impacting  which  neurons, such  effects  obviously  can  result  in  any  of  a  wide  array  of  central neuronal issues (Szukiewicz, 2024) regardless of whether any such issue is superficially categorized as a ' neurologic ' or ' cognitive ' or ' psychiatric ' or ' dysautonomic ' issue.  A  similarly  wide  array  of  direct  and\n\nTable 4b Male prevalences and odds ratios for neurologic disorders and symptoms.\n\n|                                | Prevalence in male patients   | Prevalence in male controls   | Odds ratio (95 % CI) for male MCAS patients a   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Cognitive dysfunction          | 71.9 %                        | 16.7 %                        | 11.7 (5.7 - 25.0), p < .001                     |\n| Fatigue                        | 64.9 %                        | 8.3 %                         | 18.6 (8.5 - 43.5), p < .001                     |\n| Neuropathy                     | 57.9 %                        | 12.5 %                        | 9.0 (4.4 - 19.2), p < .001                      |\n| Migraines or severe headaches  | 47.4 %                        | 10.4 %                        | 7.2 (3.4 - 15.8), p < .001                      |\n| Odor hypersensitivity          | 40.4 %                        | 2.1 %                         | 28.0 (8.9 - 124.4), p < .001                    |\n| Myalgia                        | 54.4 %                        | 8.3 %                         | 12.0 (5.5 - 27.4), p < .001                     |\n| Light Hypersensitivity         | 42.1 %                        | 2.8 %                         | 23.4 (8.3 - 84.5), p < .001                     |\n| Tinnitus                       | 47.4 %                        | 16.7 %                        | 4.7 (2.3 - 9.6), p < .001                       |\n| Fainting or near faint         | 22.8 %                        | 4.2 %                         | 5.8 (2.1 - 17.5), p < .001                      |\n| Insomnia (severe and chronic)  | 42.1 %                        | 9.0 %                         | 7.7 (3.5 - 17.8), p < .001                      |\n| Muscle weakness                | 33.3 %                        | 4.2 %                         | 10.9 (4.2 - 32.0), p < .001                     |\n| Sound hypersensitivity         | 29.8 %                        | 5.6 %                         | 6.5 (2.6 - 17.1), p < .001                      |\n| Acoustic startle               | 19.3 %                        | 6.2 %                         | 3.1 (1.2 - 8.4), p < .02                        |\n| Sleep attacks                  | 24.6 %                        | 4.9 %                         | 6.1 (2.3 - 17.2), p < .001                      |\n| Restless legs syndrome         | 33.3 %                        | 13.9 %                        | 3.0 (1.4 - 6.4), p = .003                       |\n| Pain hypersensitivity          | 29.8 %                        | 4.2 %                         | 8.8 (3.4 - 26.1), p < .001                      |\n| Tremors at rest                | 15.8 %                        | 2.8 %                         | 7.7 (2.3 - 30.6), p = .002                      |\n| Non-epileptic seizure activity | 1.8 %                         | 2.1 %                         | 0.61 (0.03 - 5.0), p = .7                       |\n| Tourette ' s Syndrome          | 1.8 %                         | 1.4 %                         | 0.76 (0.03 - 8.5), p = .8                       |\n\nindirect effects upon neurons can be seen with many other potent inflammatory mediators, too, which are expressed by MCs (some of which, unlike histamine, readily cross the BBB (e.g., interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (Banks, 1995). Though the BBB penetrability  of  another  potent  inflammatory  mediator  produced  by MCs  and  glial  cells,  IL-12  is  less  clear.  IL-12  is  clearly  involved  in pathogenesis and progression of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders (Chauhan, 2025).\n\nMCAS is often unrecognized and undiagnosed (Afrin et al., 2016-b). This multisystemic disease can account for the underlying pathophysiology in certain idiopathic syndromes including POTS, FMS, CPPS, and IBS. These syndromes have been labeled as have underlying centralized hypersensitivity. Physicians should consider trying to diagnose MCAS and using MCAS therapies as part of the approach to the complex patient who might otherwise be dismissed as having a functional neurologic or somatoform disorder.\n\nA high burden of NP manifestations has also been documented in POTS, hEDS, and fibromyalgia. In an online survey of 4835 individuals with POTS, 99 % reported dizziness or light-headedness, 94 % difficulty concentrating, 94 % headache, 87 % memory problems, 84 % myalgia, 83 % muscle weakness, 78 % tremulousness, 76 % paresthesias in the hands  and  67  %  in  the  feet,  and  75  %  blurred  vision,  65  %  hand numbness, 58 % foot numbness (Shaw et al., 2019). After POTS diagnosis, 37 % reported having a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis. Likewise, an online survey of 2596 people with fibromyalgia found that 47 % reported recurrent headaches, 46 % tingling, 45 % balance problems, 44 % numbness, 40 % chronic fatigue, 40 % depression, 38 % anxiety  and  30  %  tinnitus  (Bennett  et  al.,  2007).

Comments on specific neurological disorders and symptoms\n\nIn  the  present  study,  fatigue  and  cognitive  dysfunction  had  the highest OR (20.5 and 20.1, respectively). LDN was rated helpful by 29 % for fatigue and antihistamines were rated helpful in 22 % of patients who took LDN. LDN helped 28 % with cognitive dysfunction and antihistamines helped 22 %. Based on limitations of the questionnaire, it is not clear whether these benefits were additive using multiple medications.\n\nPOTS can be a devastating multi-systemic illness and can have comorbid MCAS (Kohno et al., 2021). In a study of 69 POTS patients, 42 % (29/69) initially diagnosed with POTS showed both additional symptoms and at least one elevated biochemical marker suggesting MCAS (Kohno et al.,  2021).  Another  study  of  the  parasympathetic  nervous system and MCs suggested that endogenous acetylcholine (receptors for which are expressed by MCs) activates meningeal MCs (Kilinc et al., 2024). Further studies are needed to delineate the complex interplay between MCs, the autonomic nervous system, connective tissues of the meninges, cerebral vasculature, and other structures important to the pathophysiology of the triad of  dysautonomia, MCAS, and hypermobility  spectrum  disorders  including  hypermobile  Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome (Wang et al., 2021).\n\nIn the present study, POTS occurred in 50.1 % of MCAS females vs. 4.1 % of control females. Studies of comorbid POTS in MCAS patients are limited. One study showed the prevalence of POTS in 24.7 % of 174 MCAS patients (Weinstock et al., 2020b). Patients with both syndromes are  often  more  ill  than  patients  with  one  disorder  alone  (Weinstock et al., 2021a,b,c). Prevalence differences could also be explained if more\n\nL.B.

The other reason could be that the  present  study  was  a  multicenter  study  whereas  the  other  study recruited patients from refractory gastrointestinal patients.\n\nFMS is a common idiopathic disorder marked by chronic widespread pain along with myalgia, muscle sensitivity, fatigue, and insomnia and is associated with migraines, atopic disorders, and depression (Fitzcharles et al., 2021; Tsiakir et al., 2017; Yepez et al., 2022). It is thought that FMS  is  primarily  caused  by  central  hypersensitivity  (Berwick  et  al., 2022), yet inflammation with cytokines produced by MCs has also been discovered to play a role and cutaneous MC counts are increased in FMS (Parkitny, Younger, 2017; Enestrom et al., 1997). All signs and symptoms of FMS overlap symptoms of MCAS, and both can start at an early age (Afrin et al., 2015, 2017; Berwick et al., 2022; Coles et al., 2021).\n\nRLS occurs in 7 -10 % of the general population, increases morbidity and mortality, and is associated with immune, inflammatory, and infectious causes in 42 highly associated disorders with secondary RLS (Li et al., 2018; Weinstock et al., 2012). In the present study, 37.2 % of females had RLS (OR 4.4) and 33.3 % of men had RLS (OR 3.0). In a prior study, 174 MCAS patients (146 female, 28 males, mean age 44.8 years) were compared to 85 spouse controls (12 females, 73 males, mean age 50.9 years). Female MCAS patients had a higher prevalence of RLS (40.8\n\n%) than spouse controls (12.9 %) (p &lt; .0001) (Weinstock et al., 2020-c). Endorphin deficiency in the brain appears to contribute to RLS and LDN could reverse this deficiency (Walters et al., 2024). In the present study, 22 % of the MCAS patients with RLS had improvement with LDN.\n\nTinnitus causes a poor quality of life (Batts, Stankovic, 2024). In the present study, 59.1 % of female patients had tinnitus with an OR of 7.4. Men had similar prevalence and OR (47.1 % and 4.7, respectively). An earlier  study  of  tinnitus  showed  a  prevalence  of  61.4  %  of  114  predominately female MCAS patients (Weinstock et al., 2021a,b,c).\n\n## 4.3. Specific comments about benzodiazepines\n\nWe have seen that benzodiazepines are sometimes being prescribed for anxiety and insomnia before the patients were diagnosed with MCAS. We have documented that anxiety and insomnia are common disorders in MCAS. Although benzodiazepines have been widely used in patients with these NP disorders, their chronic use may be associated with side effects, including sedation, abuse, dependence, and cognitive and mood alterations in a subset of patients. In our patient population with MCAS, we have found low dose, judicious use of benzodiazepines to be helpful both in the setting of chronic MC activation and/or as a treatment for an acute flare, with minimal side effects and minimal risk for development of  addiction/tolerance.  Some  patients  find  benzodiazepines  to  help abortively for flares, some find them helpful preventively using a low dose 1 -3 times daily, and some find them helpful in both contexts.\n\n## 4.4. Limitations of the study\n\nThis study has several limitations. 1) This was a volunteer study and thus participants have potential self-selection bias which could skew the data. The self-reported diagnoses, treatment and outcomes could not be confirmed and may have been influenced by recall bias. Confirmation of the survey responses was not possible in this computer-based anonymous survey. 2) There was a high percentage of female MCAS subjects, although this is representative of MCAS patients in the literature (and thought to be due in part to the activating effects  of  estrogen when engaging with MC-surface estrogen receptors) (Molderings et al., 2013; Afrin et al., 2017). 3) COVID-19 infections may have affected results by exacerbating/flaring MCAS and sparking Long COVID Syndrome (Afrin, 2020-b;  Weinstock,  2021-a).  We  addressed  this  concern  by  asking affected  participants  to  consider  their  responses  to  pre-COVID-19 symptomology. Health changes provoked by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2  infections  could  not  be  determined.  4)  Assessment  of medication response may have been influenced by concomitant neurologic and MCAS medications. MCAS patients usually are treated with multiple medications and thus judging the efficacy of adding a new one can be difficult without double-blind prospective study or using monotherapy,  which  is  not  standard  of  care  in  clinical  practice.  5)  Our questionnaire did not address how many medicine classes were used and whether more than one type of antihistamine was used. A sizable percentage  of  MCAS  patients  had  tried  one  or  more  benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepine-responsive disorders are common in MCAS, and benzodiazepines reduce MC activity in laboratory studies.\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nRecognition that NP disorders are highly prevalent in patients with MCAS may lead to promising therapeutic treatment options for patients with MCAS and those with NP disorders who are refractory to standard NP  medications  and  whose  MCAS  diagnosis  may  have  been  missed. Treatment directed at  the  uncontrolled,  aberrant  MC  can  potentially improve  some  NP  disorders  and  symptoms.  These  observations  and hypotheses  will  need  evaluation  in  future  prospective,  randomized, placebo-controlled trials.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nLeonard  B.

      "source_text_markdown": "## DOCUMENT SUMMARY\n\nThis document, \"Foundational Evidence for Narrative-Based Clinical Assessment Methods,\" is a methodological framework establishing the scientific foundation for Project Enlitens' narrative-based clinical assessment approach. It synthesizes foundational research to demonstrate that methods like semi-structured interviews , thematic analysis , and biographical narrative methods provide rigorous, valid, and therapeutically useful alternatives to traditional psychometric testing. The framework proposes a three-pillar model for implementation, combining elicitation, inquiry, and analysis.\n\n## FILENAME\n\nresearch\\_framework\\_narrative\\_assessment\\_methodology\\_v1\n\n## METADATA\n\n- Category : RESEARCH\n- Relevance : Core\n- Type : framework\n- Update Frequency : As-Needed\n- Tags : #narrative-assessment, #qualitative-research, #thematic-analysis, #semistructured-interview, #ipa, #bnim, #clinical-methodology\n- Supersedes\n- : N/A\n\n- Related Docs\n\n- : N/A\n\n## FORMATTED CONTENT\n\n## Foundational Evidence for Narrative-Based Clinical Assessment Methods\n\n## A Methodological Framework for Project Enlitens\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis comprehensive literature review establishes the scientific foundation for Project Enlitens' narrative-based clinical assessment approach. Through analysis of foundational methodological research, this document demonstrates that semistructured interviews , thematic analysis , and biographical narrative methods provide rigorous alternatives to traditional psychometric testing while maintaining scientific validity and clinical utility.\n\n## Part I: Introduction - The Scientific Case for Narrative Assessment\n\nThis report presents a methodological framework demonstrating that narrative-based clinical assessment represents not a retreat from scientific rigor, but an evidence-based evolution toward more valid and therapeutically useful evaluation methods. Its purpose is to establish the empirical foundation for Project Enlitens' rejection of impersonal checklist psychometrics in favor of collaborative, conversational assessment.\n\nThe central thesis synthesizes evidence across four methodological domains: semi-structured clinical interviews demonstrating superior validity, thematic analysis providing systematic qualitative rigor, interpretative phenomenological analysis capturing lived experience, and biographical narrative methods enabling authentic self-expression.\n\n## Part II: The Clinical Validity of Semi-Structured Interviews\n\n## Contemporary Validation of Semi-Structured Assessment: Th\u00f6ne et al. (2020)\n\nCore Concept Established: Semi-structured interviews as gold standard\n\nThis multi-center validation study of a DSM-5-based, semi-structured parent interview for childhood externalizing disorders found excellent interrater reliability for diagnoses like ADHD and ODD. The findings establish a contemporary precedent that systematic clinical conversations can achieve high reliability and validity, directly supporting a semistructured approach over rigid, standardized questionnaires.\n\n## Validation of Limited Prosocial Emotions Assessment: Waller et al. (2021)\n\nCore Concept Established: Semi-structured interview validation methodology\n\nThis study validated a semi-structured interview for assessing limited prosocial emotions in youth. It demonstrated that a conversational, interview-based method could achieve good to excellent psychometric properties, including interrater reliability and convergent validity with other established measures. This provides a direct methodological roadmap for validating Project Enlitens' own Clarity Assessment as a psychometrically sound tool.\n\n## Part III: Systematic Analysis of Narrative Data\n\n## Thematic Analysis Framework: Braun &amp; Clarke (2006)\n\nCore Concept Established: Systematic qualitative analysis methodology\n\nThis foundational paper outlines Thematic Analysis (TA) as a flexible yet rigorous method for identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within qualitative data. It provides a clear, six-phase process that allows for both inductive (\"bottom-up\") and deductive (\"top-down\") analysis.\n\nThematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data...\n\n## Key Findings :\n\n- TA is a foundational method adaptable to various theoretical frameworks.\n- The six-phase process (familiarization, coding, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining themes, writing) ensures systematic rigor.\n- It provides the methodological engine for analyzing conversational assessment data, enabling systematic theme identification in biographical narratives.\n\n## Part IV: Understanding Lived Experience\n\n## Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis: Smith, Flowers, &amp; Larkin (2009)\n\nCore Concept Established: Lived experience and meaning-making\n\nInterpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a qualitative approach focused on understanding in detail how individuals make sense of their personal and social world. It involves a \"double hermeneutic,\" or a two-stage interpretation process.\n\nIPA is therefore a double hermeneutic. The participant is trying to make sense of their world; the researcher is trying to make sense of the participant trying to make sense of their world.\n\n## Key Findings :\n\n- IPA prioritizes the participant's subjective lived experience.\n- Its philosophical foundation supports a collaborative assessment model, positioning the clinician as a co-interpreter rather than an objective assessor.\n- It uses semi-structured interviews to facilitate in-depth exploration.\n\n## Part V: Biographical Narrative Methods\n\n## Biographical-Narrative Interpretive Method: Wengraf (2001)\n\nCore Concept Established: Systematic biographical narrative analysis\n\nThe Biographical-Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) is a highly structured approach to qualitative interviewing designed to elicit and analyze life stories. A central feature is the use of a Single Question Aimed at Narrative (SQUIN).\n\nThe SQUIN is designed to elicit an extensive, uninterrupted narrative from the interviewee about their life story, using a single, open-ended question.\n\n## Key Findings :\n\n- The initial, uninterrupted narrative phase minimizes interviewer influence and reveals the narrator's own structures of relevance.\n- It separates the analysis of the lived life (biographical facts) from the told story (narrative construction), providing deep insights.\n- The method provides a replicable, validated technique for initiating biographical narratives, replacing informal prompts with an established methodological tool.\n\n## Part VI: Synthesis - A Hybrid Methodological Framework\n\n## The Enlitens Three-Pillar Model\n\nThe evidence converges on a hybrid approach for the Clarity Assessment that combines the strengths of these validated methods:\n\n- Pillar 1: Elicitation (BNIM) : Use a SQUIN -like prompt to initiate an uninterrupted biographical narrative, allowing the client to structure their own story.\n- Pillar 3: Analysis (TA) : Apply Thematic Analysis to the transcribed interview to systematically identify and analyze core themes, forming the basis of the personalized assessment report or \"User Manual.\"\n- Pillar 2: Inquiry (IPA) : Follow the initial narrative with semi-structured, phenomenological inquiry, collaboratively exploring the meaning of the client's lived experiences.",
