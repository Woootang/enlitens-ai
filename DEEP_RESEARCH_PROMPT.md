## Critical Problems to Solve

### Problem 1: Systematic LLM Hallucination (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Current State**:
```
WARNING - Attempt 1 failed: 7 validation errors for BlogContent
statistics.0.citation
  Value error, HALLUCINATION DETECTED: Citation not found in source text.
  Quote: 'Reduction in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms during pregnancy...'
statistics.1.citation
  HALLUCINATION DETECTED: Citation not found in source text.
  Quote: 'Group drumming interventions demonstrated stress reduction through HPA-axis modulation...'
```

**Pattern**:
- LLM consistently generates citations that don't exist in source documents
- Retries (temperature adjustments 0.3 → 0.7 → 0.8) don't help
- All 3 attempts fail with similar hallucination errors
- System has citation validators checking if quotes appear in source text
- Validators are working correctly (catching hallucinations), but LLM keeps generating fake citations

**Need Research On**:
1. **Latest 2024-2025 techniques** for preventing citation hallucination in RAG systems
2. **Grounding techniques** that force LLMs to only use source text
3. **Prompt engineering patterns** proven to reduce hallucination (e.g., constitutional AI, self-consistency, chain-of-verification)
4. **Two-stage approaches**: Extract quotes first, then format them separately
5. **Model selection**: Are certain models (Llama 3.3, Qwen2.5, DeepSeek, etc.) better at citation accuracy?
6. **RAG enhancements**: Better chunking strategies, citation tracking, source attribution
7. **Validation-in-the-loop**: Should we feed validation errors back into the prompt?
8. **Few-shot examples**: Demonstrating proper citation format with real examples from the document

### Problem 2: Foreman AI Resource Constraints

**Current State**:
- Foreman AI uses qwen3:32b (same as processing)
- With main processing using ~18GB, Foreman likely can't load properly

   - OpenRouter (free models: Mistral 7B, etc.)
   - Together AI (free credits)
   - Comparison of latency, quality, rate limits
3. **Model swapping strategies**:
   - Unload main model when Foreman needs to respond
   - Ollama API for model management
   - Performance impact and user experience
4. **Quantization options**:
   - Q4_K_M vs Q5_K_M vs Q8_0
   - VRAM savings vs quality loss
   - Best for monitoring/analysis tasks
