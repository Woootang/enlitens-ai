This review synthesizes current knowledge on the Personalized Brain Network architecture and its relationship with cognitive variability in both typical and neurodiverse populations. The study examines advancements in connectome-based prediction modeling, normative modeling, dynamic fingerprinting, and machine learning methods that characterize individual-specific neural networks. Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria. However, research has revealed significant network-level differences among these subgroups. Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities. However, successful translation requires overcoming challenges related to statistical power, reproducibility, ethical implementation and community participation.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience.

Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria.

Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience.

Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria.

Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience.

The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}]}

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Traditionally conceptualized as secondary emotional reactions to pain, these cognitive-affective constructs instead represent active mechanisms that shape symptom perception, behavioral responses, and long-term outcomes. In this review, we synthesize evidence across neurobiological, psychological, and clinical domains to elucidate the pathways linking PC and hopelessness to mala-daptive coping, kinesiophobia, and functional decline. Early life stress, trauma, and maladaptive cognitive schemas emerge as upstream vulnerability factors that prime heightened emotional reactivity and reduced prefrontal regulatory control, facilitating amplified pain signaling and fear-based avoidance behaviors. Avoidance and inactivity foster physical deconditioning, fatigue, and higher perceived disability, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that sustains distress and poor quality of life. Moreover, inactivi-ty-related metabolic dysfunction and weight gain may contribute to low-grade in-flammation, particularly in conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, thereby intersecting with biological disease pathways. Importantly, these psychological processes identify a distinct patient subgroup for whom further escalation of immunosuppressive therapy provides limited benefit. Instead, integrated psychological approaches - including cog-nitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and coping-skills training - demonstrate meaningful effects on catastrophizing, agency, and functional recovery. We emphasize the need for routine screening to detect patients with mala-daptive cognitive-emotional profiles and propose a stratified care model prioritizing targeted psychological interventions alongside standard rheumatologic therapy. Future research should refine phenotyping strategies, clarify neuroimmune links, and develop scalable intervention models to break the avoidance cycle and improve patient-centered outcomes.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "pdf_url": "https://www.preprints.org/frontend/manuscript/3b49ec17f8dc04731e6ce3f1b6e2ecee/download_pub", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S6309402219", "display_name": "Preprints.org", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": null, "host_organization_name": null, "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310310987"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415842783"}, {"topic": "trauma stress neuroimmune", "title": "Biomolecular Correlates of Chronic Affective Dysregulation in PTSD: A Combined Assessment Using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS) and the Serum Markers SUMO1, MDA, CX3CL1, and UCHL1", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms262010214", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently comorbid with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), indicating shared neurobiological pathways that influence stress modulation, emotional regulation, and neurohormonal adaptation.

In this cross-sectional analysis, biomarker expression was assessed in 92 male trauma-exposed participants aged 19–50 years, divided into three groups: PTSD duration ≤ 5 years (n = 33, median age 34.0 years [IQR 31.0–41.0]), PTSD duration &gt; 5 years (n = 31, median age 36.0 years [IQR 29.5–41.0]), and controls without current or past PTSD (n = 28, median age 33.5 years [IQR 24.3–41.5]). Participants were stratified into younger (19–34 years) and older (35–50 years) cohorts to account for age-related neurobiological variability. Dysthymic symptomatology was evaluated using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS), focusing on chronic subthreshold depressive features. Results indicated a significant association between PTSD and elevated dysthymic symptom burden (p &lt; 0.001), with both PTSD subgroups demonstrating mild to moderate CDRS severity compared to euthymic controls. Biomarker analysis revealed phase-dependent alterations: SUMO1 levels were significantly elevated in the ≤5 years PTSD group compared to controls (p = 0.002), suggesting early compensatory neuroprotection, whereas UCHL1 was markedly increased in the &gt;5 years PTSD group (p = 0.015), which is indicative of chronic neuronal damage and proteostatic disruption. No significant differences were observed in MDA or CX3CL1 across groups (p &gt; 0.05). These findings highlight PTSD’s contribution to sustained affective dysregulation, potentially mediated by temporal shifts in oxidative stress and protein homeostasis markers.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Traditionally conceptualized as secondary emotional reactions to pain, these cognitive-affective constructs instead represent active mechanisms that shape symptom perception, behavioral responses, and long-term outcomes. In this review, we synthesize evidence across neurobiological, psychological, and clinical domains to elucidate the pathways linking PC and hopelessness to mala-daptive coping, kinesiophobia, and functional decline. Early life stress, trauma, and maladaptive cognitive schemas emerge as upstream vulnerability factors that prime heightened emotional reactivity and reduced prefrontal regulatory control, facilitating amplified pain signaling and fear-based avoidance behaviors. Avoidance and inactivity foster physical deconditioning, fatigue, and higher perceived disability, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that sustains distress and poor quality of life. Moreover, inactivi-ty-related metabolic dysfunction and weight gain may contribute to low-grade in-flammation, particularly in conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, thereby intersecting with biological disease pathways. Importantly, these psychological processes identify a distinct patient subgroup for whom further escalation of immunosuppressive therapy provides limited benefit. Instead, integrated psychological approaches - including cog-nitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and coping-skills training - demonstrate meaningful effects on catastrophizing, agency, and functional recovery. We emphasize the need for routine screening to detect patients with mala-daptive cognitive-emotional profiles and propose a stratified care model prioritizing targeted psychological interventions alongside standard rheumatologic therapy.

In this cross-sectional analysis, biomarker expression was assessed in 92 male trauma-exposed participants aged 19–50 years, divided into three groups: PTSD duration ≤ 5 years (n = 33, median age 34.0 years [IQR 31.0–41.0]), PTSD duration &gt; 5 years (n = 31, median age 36.0 years [IQR 29.5–41.0]), and controls without current or past PTSD (n = 28, median age 33.5 years [IQR 24.3–41.5]). Participants were stratified into younger (19–34 years) and older (35–50 years) cohorts to account for age-related neurobiological variability. Dysthymic symptomatology was evaluated using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS), focusing on chronic subthreshold depressive features. Results indicated a significant association between PTSD and elevated dysthymic symptom burden (p &lt; 0.001), with both PTSD subgroups demonstrating mild to moderate CDRS severity compared to euthymic controls.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Traditionally conceptualized as secondary emotional reactions to pain, these cognitive-affective constructs instead represent active mechanisms that shape symptom perception, behavioral responses, and long-term outcomes. In this review, we synthesize evidence across neurobiological, psychological, and clinical domains to elucidate the pathways linking PC and hopelessness to mala-daptive coping, kinesiophobia, and functional decline. Early life stress, trauma, and maladaptive cognitive schemas emerge as upstream vulnerability factors that prime heightened emotional reactivity and reduced prefrontal regulatory control, facilitating amplified pain signaling and fear-based avoidance behaviors. Avoidance and inactivity foster physical deconditioning, fatigue, and higher perceived disability, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that sustains distress and poor quality of life. Moreover, inactivi-ty-related metabolic dysfunction and weight gain may contribute to low-grade in-flammation, particularly in conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, thereby intersecting with biological disease pathways. Importantly, these psychological processes identify a distinct patient subgroup for whom further escalation of immunosuppressive therapy provides limited benefit. Instead, integrated psychological approaches - including cog-nitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and coping-skills training - demonstrate meaningful effects on catastrophizing, agency, and functional recovery. We emphasize the need for routine screening to detect patients with mala-daptive cognitive-emotional profiles and propose a stratified care model prioritizing targeted psychological interventions alongside standard rheumatologic therapy. Future research should refine phenotyping strategies, clarify neuroimmune links, and develop scalable intervention models to break the avoidance cycle and improve patient-centered outcomes.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "pdf_url": "https://www.preprints.org/frontend/manuscript/3b49ec17f8dc04731e6ce3f1b6e2ecee/download_pub", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S6309402219", "display_name": "Preprints.org", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": null, "host_organization_name": null, "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310310987"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415842783"}, {"topic": "trauma stress neuroimmune", "title": "Biomolecular Correlates of Chronic Affective Dysregulation in PTSD: A Combined Assessment Using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS) and the Serum Markers SUMO1, MDA, CX3CL1, and UCHL1", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms262010214", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently comorbid with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), indicating shared neurobiological pathways that influence stress modulation, emotional regulation, and neurohormonal adaptation.

In this cross-sectional analysis, biomarker expression was assessed in 92 male trauma-exposed participants aged 19–50 years, divided into three groups: PTSD duration ≤ 5 years (n = 33, median age 34.0 years [IQR 31.0–41.0]), PTSD duration &gt; 5 years (n = 31, median age 36.0 years [IQR 29.5–41.0]), and controls without current or past PTSD (n = 28, median age 33.5 years [IQR 24.3–41.5]). Participants were stratified into younger (19–34 years) and older (35–50 years) cohorts to account for age-related neurobiological variability. Dysthymic symptomatology was evaluated using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS), focusing on chronic subthreshold depressive features. Results indicated a significant association between PTSD and elevated dysthymic symptom burden (p &lt; 0.001), with both PTSD subgroups demonstrating mild to moderate CDRS severity compared to euthymic controls. Biomarker analysis revealed phase-dependent alterations: SUMO1 levels were significantly elevated in the ≤5 years PTSD group compared to controls (p = 0.002), suggesting early compensatory neuroprotection, whereas UCHL1 was markedly increased in the &gt;5 years PTSD group (p = 0.015), which is indicative of chronic neuronal damage and proteostatic disruption. No significant differences were observed in MDA or CX3CL1 across groups (p &gt; 0.05). These findings highlight PTSD’s contribution to sustained affective dysregulation, potentially mediated by temporal shifts in oxidative stress and protein homeostasis markers.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories.

Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

We propose that the loss of PTPRD’s D1 phosphatase domain results in hyperactivated tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ( RET ) signaling in dopamine neurons, potentiating excessive downstream phosphorylation and activation of VAV2 , ERK1/2 , and PKC . We hypothesize that these mechanisms contribute to the significantly altered reward-related behaviors such as cocaine-conditioned place preference, cocaine self-administration, motivation for cocaine, and goal oriented behavior that are consistently observed across PTPRD KO/inhibition mice studies. With the inclusion of literature review, we present the first integrated multivariate genetic and mechanistic analysis aimed to identify pleiotropic, cell type-specific mechanisms driving psychiatric comorbidity at the biochemical level.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.09.17.676918", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.17.676918", "pdf_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2025/09/17/2025.09.17.676918.full.pdf", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4414340373"}, {"topic": "adhd dopamine motivation", "title": "La intrincada relación entre el alto coeficiente intelectual, el rendimiento académico y la intensidad emocional: un análisis neurocientífico y genómico multidimensional", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.57188/ricso.2025.746", "concepts": ["Humanities", "Art"], "abstract": "This research analyzes the complex relationship between high IQ, academic performance, and emotional intensity from a neuroscientific and genomic perspective.

This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Furthermore, it explores wide-ranging clinical implications across diverse conditions including trauma, chronic pain, autism, developmental disorders, and mood disorders. Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation.

Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories.

We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

We observed significant enrichment of latent genetic variables in dopamine neurons, and identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta ( PTPRD ), as a candidate gene. Literature review and gene fine-mapping suggest that PTPRD indirectly regulates DAT transporter surface trafficking and neuronal excitability.

The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals. It is concluded that school performance is the result of the interaction between intelligence, executive functioning, emotional stability, motivation, and environment, making it essential to adopt a holistic and personalized approach for the full development of highly skilled individuals.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.57188/ricso.2025.746", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.57188/ricso.2025.746", "pdf_url": "https://revistas.untumbes.edu.pe/index.php/sociales/article/download/746/1200", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4387285571", "display_name": "Revista Internacional de Ciencias Sociales", "issn_l": "2955-8778", "issn": ["2955-8778", "2955-8921"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": null, "host_organization_name": null, "host_organization_lineage": [null], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by-nc-nd", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Revista Internacional de Ciencias Sociales"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412453070"}]}

The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation.

Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Using open-sourced summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and 1000 Genomes European reference panel, we utilize a plethora of statistical frameworks to estimate shared genetic liability across MDD, BPD, and ADHD. We observed significant enrichment of latent genetic variables in dopamine neurons, and identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta ( PTPRD ), as a candidate gene. Literature review and gene fine-mapping suggest that PTPRD indirectly regulates DAT transporter surface trafficking and neuronal excitability. We propose that the loss of PTPRD’s D1 phosphatase domain results in hyperactivated tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ( RET ) signaling in dopamine neurons, potentiating excessive downstream phosphorylation and activation of VAV2 , ERK1/2 , and PKC .

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school.

This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Although high cognitive ability is traditionally associated with better academic results, empirical data and neurobiological evidence reveal that individuals with profound giftedness (IQ &gt; 145) often perform below expectations academically. This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}]}

The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory.

Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Social perception and cognition in autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "concepts": [], "abstract": null, "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "pdf_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26432-z.pdf", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S196734849", "display_name": "Scientific Reports", "issn_l": "2045-2322", "issn": ["2045-2322"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310319908", "host_organization_name": "Nature Portfolio", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310319908"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by-nc-nd", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Scientific Reports"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415905254"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Case report: Autism spectrum disorder as the basis of a feeding problem.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Parental burnout, as a form of chronic stress related to caregiving responsibilities, may lead to significant cognitive impairments that affect daily functioning and the quality of parent–child relationships.The study involved a large population divided into three groups, balanced by gender. Participants were carefully selected, and a psychological test was used to assess cognitive functions, including sustained attention, processing speed, working memory, executive functions, and cognitive flexibility. Statistical analyses included linear regression and K-means classification.The results showed that changes in cognitive functions were significantly more pronounced in the group suffering from parental burnout compared to those experiencing occupational burnout. Regression analysis confirmed the strong predictive value of parental burnout in relation to cognitive deficits. K-means classification further highlighted notable changes in attention and performance decline among parents with burnout. Stress intensity was higher in this group and was associated with chronic fatigue resulting from continuous responsibility.The study enabled differentiation between parental and occupational burnout not only on a psychological level but also on a neuropsychological level.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation.

Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories.

After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Using open-sourced summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and 1000 Genomes European reference panel, we utilize a plethora of statistical frameworks to estimate shared genetic liability across MDD, BPD, and ADHD. We observed significant enrichment of latent genetic variables in dopamine neurons, and identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta ( PTPRD ), as a candidate gene. Literature review and gene fine-mapping suggest that PTPRD indirectly regulates DAT transporter surface trafficking and neuronal excitability. We propose that the loss of PTPRD’s D1 phosphatase domain results in hyperactivated tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ( RET ) signaling in dopamine neurons, potentiating excessive downstream phosphorylation and activation of VAV2 , ERK1/2 , and PKC . We hypothesize that these mechanisms contribute to the significantly altered reward-related behaviors such as cocaine-conditioned place preference, cocaine self-administration, motivation for cocaine, and goal oriented behavior that are consistently observed across PTPRD KO/inhibition mice studies.

Although high cognitive ability is traditionally associated with better academic results, empirical data and neurobiological evidence reveal that individuals with profound giftedness (IQ &gt; 145) often perform below expectations academically. This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed.

This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school.

This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Using open-sourced summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and 1000 Genomes European reference panel, we utilize a plethora of statistical frameworks to estimate shared genetic liability across MDD, BPD, and ADHD. We observed significant enrichment of latent genetic variables in dopamine neurons, and identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta ( PTPRD ), as a candidate gene. Literature review and gene fine-mapping suggest that PTPRD indirectly regulates DAT transporter surface trafficking and neuronal excitability. We propose that the loss of PTPRD’s D1 phosphatase domain results in hyperactivated tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ( RET ) signaling in dopamine neurons, potentiating excessive downstream phosphorylation and activation of VAV2 , ERK1/2 , and PKC .

This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes.

Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school.

This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Grounded in Disability Critical Race Theory, this scoping review sought to collate and synthesise the research on the intersecting lived experiences of Autistic children and families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds to inform more culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice. The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds. This paediatric practice needs to be neurodiversity-positive, culturally affirming, and financially, geographically, physically, socially, and culturally accessible.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4404663781", "display_name": "PLOS mental health.", "issn_l": "2837-8156", "issn": ["2837-8156"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310315706", "host_organization_name": "Public Library of Science", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310315706"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "PLOS Mental Health"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105597825"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity Collaborative: Co-designing a program to enhance educator knowledge and efficacy supporting children with neurodevelopmental disabilities", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Autistic and other neurodivergent youth face social, sensory, and environmental challenges at school that negatively impact learning and well-being. Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger.

Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}]}

Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation.

Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger.

Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}]}

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Furthermore, it explores wide-ranging clinical implications across diverse conditions including trauma, chronic pain, autism, developmental disorders, and mood disorders. Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation.

Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community.

Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments.

Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Grounded in Disability Critical Race Theory, this scoping review sought to collate and synthesise the research on the intersecting lived experiences of Autistic children and families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds to inform more culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice. The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds. This paediatric practice needs to be neurodiversity-positive, culturally affirming, and financially, geographically, physically, socially, and culturally accessible.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4404663781", "display_name": "PLOS mental health.", "issn_l": "2837-8156", "issn": ["2837-8156"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310315706", "host_organization_name": "Public Library of Science", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310315706"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "PLOS Mental Health"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105597825"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity Collaborative: Co-designing a program to enhance educator knowledge and efficacy supporting children with neurodevelopmental disabilities", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Autistic and other neurodivergent youth face social, sensory, and environmental challenges at school that negatively impact learning and well-being. Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger.

Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}]}

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Social perception and cognition in autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "concepts": [], "abstract": null, "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "pdf_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26432-z.pdf", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S196734849", "display_name": "Scientific Reports", "issn_l": "2045-2322", "issn": ["2045-2322"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310319908", "host_organization_name": "Nature Portfolio", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310319908"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by-nc-nd", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Scientific Reports"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415905254"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Case report: Autism spectrum disorder as the basis of a feeding problem.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Parental burnout, as a form of chronic stress related to caregiving responsibilities, may lead to significant cognitive impairments that affect daily functioning and the quality of parent–child relationships.The study involved a large population divided into three groups, balanced by gender. Participants were carefully selected, and a psychological test was used to assess cognitive functions, including sustained attention, processing speed, working memory, executive functions, and cognitive flexibility. Statistical analyses included linear regression and K-means classification.The results showed that changes in cognitive functions were significantly more pronounced in the group suffering from parental burnout compared to those experiencing occupational burnout. Regression analysis confirmed the strong predictive value of parental burnout in relation to cognitive deficits. K-means classification further highlighted notable changes in attention and performance decline among parents with burnout. Stress intensity was higher in this group and was associated with chronic fatigue resulting from continuous responsibility.The study enabled differentiation between parental and occupational burnout not only on a psychological level but also on a neuropsychological level.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience.

Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school.

This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

Grounded in Disability Critical Race Theory, this scoping review sought to collate and synthesise the research on the intersecting lived experiences of Autistic children and families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds to inform more culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice. The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds. This paediatric practice needs to be neurodiversity-positive, culturally affirming, and financially, geographically, physically, socially, and culturally accessible.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4404663781", "display_name": "PLOS mental health.", "issn_l": "2837-8156", "issn": ["2837-8156"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310315706", "host_organization_name": "Public Library of Science", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310315706"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "PLOS Mental Health"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105597825"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity Collaborative: Co-designing a program to enhance educator knowledge and efficacy supporting children with neurodevelopmental disabilities", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Autistic and other neurodivergent youth face social, sensory, and environmental challenges at school that negatively impact learning and well-being. Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to development, resulting in a training that was well received and conducive to implementation. Future work will test the effects of the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training on youth outcomes and explore the role of professional learning communities to support implementation and sustain change. Lay Abstract Neurodivergent children are children who have neurodevelopmental or cognitive disabilities (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain injury, dyslexia, Tourette’s, and other neurological disorders). Neurodivergent children have heightened risk for mental health problems and poor learning outcomes compared to their peers. Sadly, school experiences contribute to these poor outcomes. Every day, neurodivergent children face a multitude of barriers and negative events at school that exacerbate their neurocognitive, sensory, and social communication differences, and even make them feel unsafe. Educators do not have the knowledge of how to support neurodivergent children and cannot practically provide individualized supports to each neurodivergent child in their classroom. A new approach is needed to ensure that school is a positive, enriching experience instead of the stressful, negative experience that it is for most neurodivergent students. This project aimed to transform schools for neurodivergent children by giving public school educators the knowledge they need to create a safe and inclusive school climate for all children. We developed the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training with a group of researchers, teachers, counselors, principals, administrators, and advocates all with personal connections to neurodiversity. The Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program teaches a series of practical tools to design classrooms and instruction in ways that eliminate unnecessary barriers and set neurodivergent children up for success at school. We tested the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program in one school district with 192 educators. Results suggest that this program is agreeable to teachers and improves their knowledge and confidence in supporting their neurodivergent children. Future work will test how the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity training program helps neurodivergent youth directly and if teachers can sustain these positive changes in knowledge and confidence.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251388627", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251388627", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105620463"}, {"topic": "autism neurodiversity", "title": "“From the autistic human books’ stories, I understand their mindset and thoughts”: Pilot development and participatory realist evaluation of Human Library to enhance public understanding of autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "concepts": ["Autism", "Psychology", "Mindset", "Citizen journalism", "Human development (humanity)"], "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-being, which shaped how they would interact with autistic people in the community. The Human Library model has implications for promoting better understanding and attitudes of autism and fostering positive interaction between autistic and non-autistic people. Lay Abstract There is a need to promote autism awareness and understanding in the public. Traditional methods often include direct teaching and sharing of facts about autism, but more creative and effective approaches are needed. Human Library (HL) works like an actual library, except that “books” are human beings who can share their lives and stories. This study developed and evaluated a Human Library specifically with autistic books to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. We conducted surveys and interviews with the participating readers to understand how the Human Library works and its effects. After Human Library, readers reported decreased autism stigma and increased neurodiversity attitudes. Readers showed different understanding of autism contrary to their previous impressions. They appreciated more the strengths and perspectives of autistic individuals. They also considered more the autistic perspective when interacting with autistic people. Human Library can be an effective program to promote better understanding and attitudes of autism in the public.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1177/13623613251377949", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251377949", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S1824407", "display_name": "Autism", "issn_l": "1362-3613", "issn": ["1362-3613", "1461-7005"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320017", "host_organization_name": "SAGE Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320017"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Autism"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105635715"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility.

The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Social perception and cognition in autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "concepts": [], "abstract": null, "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "pdf_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26432-z.pdf", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S196734849", "display_name": "Scientific Reports", "issn_l": "2045-2322", "issn": ["2045-2322"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310319908", "host_organization_name": "Nature Portfolio", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310319908"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by-nc-nd", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Scientific Reports"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415905254"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Case report: Autism spectrum disorder as the basis of a feeding problem.

We observed significant enrichment of latent genetic variables in dopamine neurons, and identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta ( PTPRD ), as a candidate gene. Literature review and gene fine-mapping suggest that PTPRD indirectly regulates DAT transporter surface trafficking and neuronal excitability. We propose that the loss of PTPRD’s D1 phosphatase domain results in hyperactivated tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ( RET ) signaling in dopamine neurons, potentiating excessive downstream phosphorylation and activation of VAV2 , ERK1/2 , and PKC .

Although high cognitive ability is traditionally associated with better academic results, empirical data and neurobiological evidence reveal that individuals with profound giftedness (IQ &gt; 145) often perform below expectations academically. This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}]}

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Social perception and cognition in autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "concepts": [], "abstract": null, "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "pdf_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26432-z.pdf", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S196734849", "display_name": "Scientific Reports", "issn_l": "2045-2322", "issn": ["2045-2322"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310319908", "host_organization_name": "Nature Portfolio", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310319908"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by-nc-nd", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Scientific Reports"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415905254"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Case report: Autism spectrum disorder as the basis of a feeding problem.

Grounded in Disability Critical Race Theory, this scoping review sought to collate and synthesise the research on the intersecting lived experiences of Autistic children and families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds to inform more culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice. The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory.

This paediatric practice needs to be neurodiversity-positive, culturally affirming, and financially, geographically, physically, socially, and culturally accessible.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4404663781", "display_name": "PLOS mental health.", "issn_l": "2837-8156", "issn": ["2837-8156"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310315706", "host_organization_name": "Public Library of Science", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310315706"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "PLOS Mental Health"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105597825"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds. This paediatric practice needs to be neurodiversity-positive, culturally affirming, and financially, geographically, physically, socially, and culturally accessible.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4404663781", "display_name": "PLOS mental health.", "issn_l": "2837-8156", "issn": ["2837-8156"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310315706", "host_organization_name": "Public Library of Science", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310315706"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "PLOS Mental Health"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105597825"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Social perception and cognition in autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "concepts": [], "abstract": null, "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "pdf_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26432-z.pdf", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S196734849", "display_name": "Scientific Reports", "issn_l": "2045-2322", "issn": ["2045-2322"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310319908", "host_organization_name": "Nature Portfolio", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310319908"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by-nc-nd", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Scientific Reports"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415905254"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Case report: Autism spectrum disorder as the basis of a feeding problem.

Using open-sourced summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and 1000 Genomes European reference panel, we utilize a plethora of statistical frameworks to estimate shared genetic liability across MDD, BPD, and ADHD. We observed significant enrichment of latent genetic variables in dopamine neurons, and identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor delta ( PTPRD ), as a candidate gene. Literature review and gene fine-mapping suggest that PTPRD indirectly regulates DAT transporter surface trafficking and neuronal excitability. We propose that the loss of PTPRD’s D1 phosphatase domain results in hyperactivated tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ( RET ) signaling in dopamine neurons, potentiating excessive downstream phosphorylation and activation of VAV2 , ERK1/2 , and PKC .

Although high cognitive ability is traditionally associated with better academic results, empirical data and neurobiological evidence reveal that individuals with profound giftedness (IQ &gt; 145) often perform below expectations academically. This paradox is attributed to a neural architecture that favors high synaptic intensity, resulting simultaneously in advanced abstract reasoning and greater emotional vulnerability. The role of hyperconnectivity between the prefrontal cortex, the limbic system, and other brain structures stands out, as does the impact of neurochemical modulation involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Data obtained from the “Gifted Debate” group corroborate that factors such as intrinsic motivation, emotional stability, and executive regulation are determinants of academic success, often more relevant than IQ itself. In addition, profiles of dual exceptionality, such as giftedness associated with ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder, reinforce the need to understand the neurobiological and emotional singularities of these individuals.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}]}

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Traditionally conceptualized as secondary emotional reactions to pain, these cognitive-affective constructs instead represent active mechanisms that shape symptom perception, behavioral responses, and long-term outcomes. In this review, we synthesize evidence across neurobiological, psychological, and clinical domains to elucidate the pathways linking PC and hopelessness to mala-daptive coping, kinesiophobia, and functional decline. Early life stress, trauma, and maladaptive cognitive schemas emerge as upstream vulnerability factors that prime heightened emotional reactivity and reduced prefrontal regulatory control, facilitating amplified pain signaling and fear-based avoidance behaviors. Avoidance and inactivity foster physical deconditioning, fatigue, and higher perceived disability, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that sustains distress and poor quality of life. Moreover, inactivi-ty-related metabolic dysfunction and weight gain may contribute to low-grade in-flammation, particularly in conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, thereby intersecting with biological disease pathways. Importantly, these psychological processes identify a distinct patient subgroup for whom further escalation of immunosuppressive therapy provides limited benefit. Instead, integrated psychological approaches - including cog-nitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and coping-skills training - demonstrate meaningful effects on catastrophizing, agency, and functional recovery. We emphasize the need for routine screening to detect patients with mala-daptive cognitive-emotional profiles and propose a stratified care model prioritizing targeted psychological interventions alongside standard rheumatologic therapy. Future research should refine phenotyping strategies, clarify neuroimmune links, and develop scalable intervention models to break the avoidance cycle and improve patient-centered outcomes.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "pdf_url": "https://www.preprints.org/frontend/manuscript/3b49ec17f8dc04731e6ce3f1b6e2ecee/download_pub", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S6309402219", "display_name": "Preprints.org", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": null, "host_organization_name": null, "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310310987"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415842783"}, {"topic": "trauma stress neuroimmune", "title": "Biomolecular Correlates of Chronic Affective Dysregulation in PTSD: A Combined Assessment Using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS) and the Serum Markers SUMO1, MDA, CX3CL1, and UCHL1", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms262010214", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently comorbid with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), indicating shared neurobiological pathways that influence stress modulation, emotional regulation, and neurohormonal adaptation.

In this cross-sectional analysis, biomarker expression was assessed in 92 male trauma-exposed participants aged 19–50 years, divided into three groups: PTSD duration ≤ 5 years (n = 33, median age 34.0 years [IQR 31.0–41.0]), PTSD duration &gt; 5 years (n = 31, median age 36.0 years [IQR 29.5–41.0]), and controls without current or past PTSD (n = 28, median age 33.5 years [IQR 24.3–41.5]). Participants were stratified into younger (19–34 years) and older (35–50 years) cohorts to account for age-related neurobiological variability. Dysthymic symptomatology was evaluated using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS), focusing on chronic subthreshold depressive features. Results indicated a significant association between PTSD and elevated dysthymic symptom burden (p &lt; 0.001), with both PTSD subgroups demonstrating mild to moderate CDRS severity compared to euthymic controls. Biomarker analysis revealed phase-dependent alterations: SUMO1 levels were significantly elevated in the ≤5 years PTSD group compared to controls (p = 0.002), suggesting early compensatory neuroprotection, whereas UCHL1 was markedly increased in the &gt;5 years PTSD group (p = 0.015), which is indicative of chronic neuronal damage and proteostatic disruption. No significant differences were observed in MDA or CX3CL1 across groups (p &gt; 0.05). These findings highlight PTSD’s contribution to sustained affective dysregulation, potentially mediated by temporal shifts in oxidative stress and protein homeostasis markers.

We write as an international collective of researchers and professionals, many of whom are neurodivergent and/or disabled, including ADHDers and parents of ADHDers. Learning from autism advocacy and disability studies, we emphasise how participatory research may improve ADHD narratives, thereby influencing knowledge generation. While acknowledging challenges such as institutional constraints, we advocate for coordinated individual and systemic efforts toward language reform.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

Finally, the paper advocates for applying a \"science of safety\" in clinical practice, education, and public health, offering future directions for research, clinical practice, and the systemic design of institutions that support physiological safety at scale.", "primary_location": {"id": "pmid:40735382", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40735382", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306525036", "display_name": "PubMed", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I1299303238", "host_organization_name": "National Institutes of Health", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I1299303238"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": null}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Clinical neuropsychiatry"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4412785981"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Neuroception of psychological safety scale (NPSS): validation with a UK based adult community sample", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "concepts": ["Sample (material)", "Scale (ratio)", "Psychology", "Clinical psychology", "Applied psychology"], "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Psychological safety plays a vital role in rest, recovery, and fostering social connections. However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample. Further work is underway to support and enhance understandings of psychological safety with diverse clinical populations impacted by trauma. The NPSS has applicability across a range of health and social care contexts, such as shaping new approaches to evaluating trauma treatments and enhancing trauma informed care.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2490329", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S2737785665", "display_name": "European journal of psychotraumatology", "issn_l": "2000-8066", "issn": ["2000-8066"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320547", "host_organization_name": "Taylor & Francis", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320547"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "European Journal of Psychotraumatology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4410129222"}, {"topic": "polyvagal social engagement", "title": "Harnessing non‑invasive vagal neuromodulation: HRV biofeedback and SSP for cardiovascular and autonomic regulation (Review)", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "concepts": ["Neuromodulation", "Biofeedback", "Autonomic nervous system", "Heart rate variability", "Medicine"], "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system plays a central role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, with the vagus nerve as a crucial component. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

Traditionally conceptualized as secondary emotional reactions to pain, these cognitive-affective constructs instead represent active mechanisms that shape symptom perception, behavioral responses, and long-term outcomes. In this review, we synthesize evidence across neurobiological, psychological, and clinical domains to elucidate the pathways linking PC and hopelessness to mala-daptive coping, kinesiophobia, and functional decline. Early life stress, trauma, and maladaptive cognitive schemas emerge as upstream vulnerability factors that prime heightened emotional reactivity and reduced prefrontal regulatory control, facilitating amplified pain signaling and fear-based avoidance behaviors. Avoidance and inactivity foster physical deconditioning, fatigue, and higher perceived disability, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that sustains distress and poor quality of life. Moreover, inactivi-ty-related metabolic dysfunction and weight gain may contribute to low-grade in-flammation, particularly in conditions such as psoriatic arthritis, thereby intersecting with biological disease pathways. Importantly, these psychological processes identify a distinct patient subgroup for whom further escalation of immunosuppressive therapy provides limited benefit. Instead, integrated psychological approaches - including cog-nitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and coping-skills training - demonstrate meaningful effects on catastrophizing, agency, and functional recovery. We emphasize the need for routine screening to detect patients with mala-daptive cognitive-emotional profiles and propose a stratified care model prioritizing targeted psychological interventions alongside standard rheumatologic therapy. Future research should refine phenotyping strategies, clarify neuroimmune links, and develop scalable intervention models to break the avoidance cycle and improve patient-centered outcomes.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202511.0103.v1", "pdf_url": "https://www.preprints.org/frontend/manuscript/3b49ec17f8dc04731e6ce3f1b6e2ecee/download_pub", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S6309402219", "display_name": "Preprints.org", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": null, "host_organization_name": null, "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310310987"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415842783"}, {"topic": "trauma stress neuroimmune", "title": "Biomolecular Correlates of Chronic Affective Dysregulation in PTSD: A Combined Assessment Using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS) and the Serum Markers SUMO1, MDA, CX3CL1, and UCHL1", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms262010214", "concepts": [], "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently comorbid with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), indicating shared neurobiological pathways that influence stress modulation, emotional regulation, and neurohormonal adaptation. This study examines the roles of serum biomarkers—small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1), malondialdehyde (MDA), fractalkine (CX3CL1), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1)—involved in oxidative stress management, neuroimmune regulation, and neuronal proteostasis. In this cross-sectional analysis, biomarker expression was assessed in 92 male trauma-exposed participants aged 19–50 years, divided into three groups: PTSD duration ≤ 5 years (n = 33, median age 34.0 years [IQR 31.0–41.0]), PTSD duration &gt; 5 years (n = 31, median age 36.0 years [IQR 29.5–41.0]), and controls without current or past PTSD (n = 28, median age 33.5 years [IQR 24.3–41.5]). Participants were stratified into younger (19–34 years) and older (35–50 years) cohorts to account for age-related neurobiological variability. Dysthymic symptomatology was evaluated using the Cornell Dysthymia Rating Scale (CDRS), focusing on chronic subthreshold depressive features. Results indicated a significant association between PTSD and elevated dysthymic symptom burden (p &lt; 0.001), with both PTSD subgroups demonstrating mild to moderate CDRS severity compared to euthymic controls. Biomarker analysis revealed phase-dependent alterations: SUMO1 levels were significantly elevated in the ≤5 years PTSD group compared to controls (p = 0.002), suggesting early compensatory neuroprotection, whereas UCHL1 was markedly increased in the &gt;5 years PTSD group (p = 0.015), which is indicative of chronic neuronal damage and proteostatic disruption. No significant differences were observed in MDA or CX3CL1 across groups (p &gt; 0.05). These findings highlight PTSD’s contribution to sustained affective dysregulation, potentially mediated by temporal shifts in oxidative stress and protein homeostasis markers. Clinically, this supports the utility of biomarker profiling for risk stratification, early intervention, and personalized therapeutic strategies, such as targeted modulation of SUMOylation or UCHL1 activity, to enhance neuroresilience and mitigate progression to severe mood disorders.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3390/ijms262010214", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms262010214", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/20/10214/pdf?version=1761038009", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S10623703", "display_name": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences", "issn_l": "1422-0067", "issn": ["1422-0067", "1661-6596"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310310987", "host_organization_name": "Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310310987"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "International Journal of Molecular Sciences"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415403060"}, {"topic": "trauma stress neuroimmune", "title": "Isolation and Dissection Procedures for EGC Isolation by Human Mucosal Biopsies", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4795-0_6", "concepts": [], "abstract": null, "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1007/978-1-0716-4795-0_6", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-4795-0_6", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210172139", "display_name": "Methods in molecular biology", "issn_l": "1064-3745", "issn": ["1064-3745", "1940-6029"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310319900", "host_organization_name": "Springer Science+Business Media", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310319900"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "book series", "raw_type": "book-chapter"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Methods in Molecular Biology"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4414639527"}]}

This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent across the NPSS's subscales. Providing support for the validity of the NPSS, scores were predictably related to team psychological safety, wellbeing, post-traumatic stress, burnout, body awareness, and personality, with effect sizes typically in the high to medium range. Scores on the NPSS were found to show good test-retest reliability.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the validity, reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS with an adult sample.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols. Together, HRV-B and SSP represent promising avenues for enhancing vagal neuromodulation in both preventive and therapeutic settings.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.3892/mi.2025.236", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.3892/mi.2025.236", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4210195194", "display_name": "Medicine International", "issn_l": "2754-1304", "issn": ["2754-1304", "2754-3242"], "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310320412", "host_organization_name": "Spandidos Publishing", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310320412"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Medicine International"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4409945392"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Social perception and cognition in autism", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "concepts": [], "abstract": null, "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-26432-z", "pdf_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-26432-z.pdf", "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S196734849", "display_name": "Scientific Reports", "issn_l": "2045-2322", "issn": ["2045-2322"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": true, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310319908", "host_organization_name": "Nature Portfolio", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310319908"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by-nc-nd", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by-nc-nd", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "Scientific Reports"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W4415905254"}, {"topic": "autism sensory regulation", "title": "Case report: Autism spectrum disorder as the basis of a feeding problem.

Grounded in Disability Critical Race Theory, this scoping review sought to collate and synthesise the research on the intersecting lived experiences of Autistic children and families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds to inform more culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice. The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds. This paediatric practice needs to be neurodiversity-positive, culturally affirming, and financially, geographically, physically, socially, and culturally accessible.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4404663781", "display_name": "PLOS mental health.", "issn_l": "2837-8156", "issn": ["2837-8156"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310315706", "host_organization_name": "Public Library of Science", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310315706"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "PLOS Mental Health"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105597825"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.

The authors systematically searched 8 databases up to June 2025. Extracted data from included articles were analysed using qualitative content analysis informed by Disability Critical Race Theory. Fifty-six studies were included in this scoping review, with a total of 1454 participants across the included studies. Findings illuminated that families had difficulty learning about and understanding autism, gaining access to services that met their cultural and language needs, and experienced disability-based stigma and racism. Families thrived when they were provided opportunities to learn about autism and available resources, could advocate for their child and others, access services from providers they trusted, and have their Autistic child celebrated within their community. To reduce inequities, there is a need for service providers to conduct culturally attuned paediatric clinical practice that centres the priorities of Autistic children and their families from racially and ethnically minoritized backgrounds. This paediatric practice needs to be neurodiversity-positive, culturally affirming, and financially, geographically, physically, socially, and culturally accessible.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "is_oa": true, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000481", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4404663781", "display_name": "PLOS mental health.", "issn_l": "2837-8156", "issn": ["2837-8156"], "is_oa": true, "is_in_doaj": true, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/P4310315706", "host_organization_name": "Public Library of Science", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/P4310315706"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "journal", "raw_type": "journal-article"}, "license": "cc-by", "license_id": "https://openalex.org/licenses/cc-by", "version": "publishedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": true, "raw_source_name": "PLOS Mental Health"}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7105597825"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Sex Dependent Effects of Minocycline on Contextual Fear Memory", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "concepts": ["Minocycline", "Extinction (optical mineralogy)", "Forgetting", "Psychology", "Pathological"], "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of microglia in fear learning and memory. This supports the potential therapeutic value of the anti-inflammatory agent minocycline, which regulates microglial activity, in psychiatric disorders involving dysregulated emotional memory. To assess the impact of minocycline during a tractable intervention window, we examined its acute systemic effects on the reconsolidation, extinction, and forgetting of contextual fear memory (CFM) in rats. Our findings show that the effects of minocycline on fear memory and anxiety-like behaviours depend on sex, memory activation (i.e., whether it was retrieved), and memory age. In males with recently acquired CFM, minocycline given before retrieval enhanced extinction and reduced fear expression. When administered without retrieval, it disrupted passive forgetting, increasing evoked fear behaviour. This extinction-enhancing effect did not occur with older (28-day) memories rather it strengthened CFM through enhancing reconsolidation. In contrast, in females, minocycline increased the expression of recent fear memories regardless of retrieval, without affecting extinction or forgetting. This elevated fear expression appeared linked to heightened anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that minocycline, or other microglia-targeting agents, would need to be used in a highly selective and targeted manner to therapeutically modulate pathological fear memories. Minocycline may be beneficial as an adjunct to exposure therapy in men explicitly retrieving recent fear or trauma-related memories, but outside these conditions, it may worsen fear expression. These results help explain the mixed findings from therapeutic trials using minocycline in psychiatry and support the application of a more precision approach in any future applications.", "primary_location": {"id": "doi:10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "is_oa": false, "landing_page_url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.11.687783", "pdf_url": null, "source": {"id": "https://openalex.org/S4306402567", "display_name": "bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)", "issn_l": null, "issn": null, "is_oa": false, "is_in_doaj": false, "is_core": false, "host_organization": "https://openalex.org/I2750212522", "host_organization_name": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory", "host_organization_lineage": ["https://openalex.org/I2750212522"], "host_organization_lineage_names": [], "type": "repository", "raw_type": "posted-content"}, "license": null, "license_id": null, "version": "acceptedVersion", "is_accepted": true, "is_published": false, "raw_source_name": null}, "id": "https://openalex.org/W7104838767"}, {"topic": "trauma memory reconsolidation", "title": "Open MDMA: An Evidence-Based Synthesis, Theory, and Manual for MDMA Therapy Based on Predictive Processing, Complex Systems, and the Defense Cascade", "year": 2025, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aps5g_v5", "concepts": ["MDMA", "Patience", "Psychology", "Autonomy", "Session (web analytics)"], "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information.

The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Design Discursive paper. Methods Directed literature synthesis (2010–2025) across nursing, organisational psychology, labour economics and health‐policy databases; thematic mapping of findings to organisational support theory, ethics‐of‐care theory and role theory; cross‐case comparison of four national leave frameworks. Results Paid, discretionary leave raises perceived organisational support and predicts lower turnover intention. Leave is framed as moral reciprocity and restores both relational energy and capacity for job satisfaction. Extended, clearly sign‐posted leave reduces time‐ and strain‐based work–family conflict, enabling role enrichment on return. Implementation rests on four structural interventions: leadership endorsement, streamlined processes, guaranteed staffing back‐fill and phased return‐to‐work options. Conclusion Paid parental leave is a strategic, theory‐grounded intervention that safeguards nurses' dual identities, amplifies organisational commitment and ultimately fortifies patient care quality. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care Embedding usable, fully paid leave normalises caregiving, reduces burnout triggers and stabilises staffing to promote nurse retention, continuity of care and positive patient outcomes. Impact What problem did the study address? Global nurse turnover driven by unmanageable work–family conflict and inadequate leave usability. What were the main findings? Generous, well‐implemented leave improves perceived support, relational energy and retention; four structural interventions maximize the benefits of paid parental leave for nurse‐parents, patients, organizations, and the nursing workforce. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Onurse leaders, HR policymakers and health‐system executives striving to stem workforce attrition and on patient populations reliant on stable, experienced nursing teams.

However, a history of trauma can predispose individuals to perceive heightened levels of threat and danger. Research suggests that a lack of psychological safety may be a defining biopsychosocial characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Persistent feelings of threat and danger are associated with a lack of psychological safety and may be predictive of PTSD. Our pioneering work reported on the development of the neuroception of psychological safety (NPSS), rooted in polyvagal theory, and consists of social engagement, compassion, and body sensations dimensions. Understanding more about the dimensionality of the NPSS and further establishing its psychometric properties was our priority.<b>Objective:</b> Our current research aimed to validate and test the reliability and dimensionality of the NPSS, using a large community sample (<i>n</i> = 2035) of adult residents in the UK<b>Method</b>: We examined the internal and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity as well as dimensionality of the NPSS.<b>Results:</b> The 3-factor structure of the NPSS was replicated with regard to the absolute fit indices.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive biomarker of vagal tone and autonomic flexibility. A reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, inflammation and mental health disorders. The present narrative review discusses two promising non-invasive interventions designed to enhance vagal activity: HRV biofeedback (HRV-B) and the safe and sound protocol (SSP). HRV-B utilizes paced breathing at an individual's resonance frequency combined with real-time HRV monitoring to strengthen baroreflex sensitivity, improve autonomic balance, reduce systemic inflammation and enhance emotional regulation. Extensive research supports the efficacy of HRV-B in improving cardiovascular outcomes, managing hypertension, reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, and fostering resilience. By contrast, SSP is a relatively newer auditory-based intervention grounded in the polyvagal theory. It targets the ventral vagal complex through filtered music to promote social engagement, emotional regulation, and parasympathetic activation. Preliminary studies suggest SSP may benefit individuals with autism spectrum disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease; however, large-scale controlled trials are needed to validate its clinical efficacy. By bridging cardiovascular, neurological and psychological domains, both HRV-B and SSP offer innovative non-invasive strategies for promoting health and resilience. The review highlights the mechanisms, clinical applications, and outcomes associated with each approach, while also discussing current limitations, such as individual variability, adherence challenges, and the need for further research. Future directions include integrating wearable HRV monitoring, AI-driven adaptive biofeedback, and expanding investigation across diverse populations to optimize clinical protocols.
