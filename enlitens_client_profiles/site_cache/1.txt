B E P R O U D O F W H O Y O U A R E Your Brain Isn’t Broken. Your Tools Are. For years, you’ve been handed the wrong tools. The generic advice, the one-size-fits-all planners, the “just think positively” worksheets—tools that were never designed for the unique, high-performance architecture of your brain. When they inevitably don’t work, it’s easy to believe the lie that you are the one who is broken.You are not. You have just been given the wrong user manual.Enlitens was built to be a safe harbor for the misfits, the rebels, and the neuro-spicy brains who know, in their bones, that there has to be a better way. We don’t believe in generic solutions that pathologize who you are. We believe in a simple, rebellious truth: every brain makes perfect sense for the life it’s lived. Instead of trying to force you into a pre-existing box, we work with you to build a custom set of tools that actually fit your life. Our work is divided into four core missions: For ADHD & Autistic Brains: We help you deconstruct the bulls*hit, translate your brain’s unique operating system, and build a life that celebrates your strengths instead of punishing your differences. Explore ADHD & Autism Support For Anxious & Burnt-Out Nervous Systems: We go beyond “managing” anxiety and depression. We teach you the science of your nervous system so you can stop silencing its alarms and start addressing the source of the fire. Explore Anxiety & Mood Care For Overwhelmed Executive Functions: This isn’t about “trying harder.” This is about practical, hands-on, no-bulls*hit coaching to help you build the systems and strategies you need to manage your life, your work, and your home. Explore Executive Function Coaching For Survivors of a Traumatic World: We provide a “body-first,” neuro-informed approach to trauma that prioritizes your safety above all else. We help you heal the wound, not just talk about the story. Explore Trauma-Informed ND Care This is more than a practice; it’s a community where you can find your people. It’s a workshop where you can get the right tools. And it’s a rebellion where you can build a life that is authentically, unapologetically yours. Testing That Doesn’t Suck. Our Clarity Assessments give you a roadmap, not just a label. Let’s talk about the racket that is neurodivergent testing. The standard process is a masterclass in frustration and systemic failure. You know the drill: you summon the immense executive function it takes to make the call, only to be put on an eight-month waitlist. You’re forced to take days off work for a series of cold, sterile, and often traumatizing tests. And at the end of it all, you’re handed a multi-thousand-dollar bill. And for what? A cold, clinical report that pathologizes who you are, a dense PDF filled with jargon and a list of your “deficits” that offers no real-world solutions. We think that’s garbage. That process is not designed for your healing; it is designed for the convenience of the system. We reject it entirely. Our Clarity Assessment is not just a different set of tests; it is a fundamentally different philosophy. The traditional assessment process is a masterclass in making human beings feel like lab rats. It’s a system built to find deficits, rooted in outdated science that compares you to a mythical “normal” person who doesn’t actually exist. We believe an assessment should be the most validating, empowering, and profoundly hopeful experience you’ve ever had in a clinical setting. It should be a collaborative investigation that ends not with a verdict, but with a celebration of your unique mind. It is the difference between an autopsy and an origin story. We are not here to catalogue your flaws. We are here to help you finally, finally make sense of your own brilliant, complicated, and powerful story. Traditional Testing PRICE A $3,500+ “cash grab” designed to make money, not provide answers. You’re billed for opaque “material fees” that benefit the evaluator, not you. PROCESS A cold, robotic interrogation. You’re judged on the “correct” way to play with toys. If you’ve experienced trauma, your experience is often dismissed as “just trauma,” invalidating your neurodivergence entirely. RESULT A useless, jargon-filled PDF you can’t understand. It’s a list of what’s “wrong” with you, ending with, “Congratulations, you’re autistic. Now figure it out”. The Enlitens Way PRICE Radical transparency. A simple $100 hourly rate , that’s it. Our goal isn’t to make money off tests; it’s to make answers accessible and equitable. PROCESS A real, collaborative conversation. We explore your whole life—your strengths, sensory needs, and patterns. There are no trap questions. We listen. We believe you. Our process is guided by affirming principles from tools like the DIVA and MIGDAS, but centered on your lived experience. RESULT Your “User Manual for Your Brain”. You get a guide written in plain English, directly to you. It celebrates your strengths, offers actionable recommendations, and gives you a clear path forward. Our Clarity Assessments are powerful standalone tools, but they also make therapy incredibly effective from day one. The final roadmap becomes our shared guide, allowing us to skip the guesswork and get straight to the work that matters. Answers, Not Labels Here’s the real tea: That quiz is bullsh*t. Those scores and labels? They don’t mean anything. We just used a bunch of terms you’ve probably seen on TikTok. If you related to any of those scenarios, you’re not a “Panic Room” or a “Chaos Coordinator.” You’re a person with a unique brain trying to navigate real challenges. That’s it. At Enlitens, we don’t give you a label and a pat on the back. We help you understand your own brain and give you tools that actually fit your life. Want the real answer? Click below to learn more about getting started with Enlitens. What to Expect Next Let's Be Real: The Therapy World is Kind of Broken. Too many therapy practices feel cold and clinical. They put you in a box, hand you a diagnosis, and forget you’re a person who has to navigate the real world. That’s one part of the problem. Here’s the other part you don’t see: over half the people who earn a counseling degree never become fully licensed. They’re thrown into a system that overworks, under-supports, and burns them out, leaving huge gaps in care for communities that need it most. Enlitens is my answer. It’s a rebellion against that broken system, built on one simple idea: if we take better care of our therapists, they can take better care of you. The vision for this practice is to be a collaborative—a launchpad where new counselors get the mentorship, support, and low-cost supervision they need to thrive and build their own practices. That’s how we change the game and fix the gaps in care. For now, the rebellion starts with one. Meet the founder of the movement. Want to know more about our pricing? Cost & Insurance What is the cost of ADHD or Autism testing in St. Louis? We are committed to radical transparency in our pricing. While traditional testing can cost thousands, our Clarity Assessments are different. We charge a simple, transparent $100 per hour for all assessment-related work. There are no hidden fees. Our goal is to make answers accessible, not to make money off of tests. Read our full takedown of the “assessment cash grab.” Are you an LGBTQ-affirming therapist in St. Louis? 100%. We don’t just use “affirming” as a buzzword—we live it. This practice was built from the ground up to be a genuinely safe and celebratory space for the entire LGBTQIA+ community. Your identity, your pronouns, and your experience will be understood, respected, and honored here. Full stop. Read our manifesto on what “affirming” actually means. Do you take my insurance or offer a sliding scale? We work with both to make care as accessible as possible. We are in-network for therapy with several major providers, and we offer a simple, no-judgment sliding scale for those who need it. We will have a real, transparent conversation about what is sustainable for you. Read our brutally honest guide to our sliding scale and insurance. What happens in the free 15-minute "fit-check" call? Think of it as a low-pressure “vibe check” for your therapy journey. It is not a therapy session or a clinical intake. It’s your chance to vet us. It’s just a simple, free conversation for us to see if we’re a good fit to work together. No pressure. No surprises. Learn more about the “vibe check” here. What if my last therapist didn't "get" neurodiversity? We hear this all the time, and it’s one of the main reasons Enlitens exists. It’s incredibly frustrating when you have to educate your own therapist. As an AuDHD therapist, Liz’s entire practice is built on a neurodiversity-affirming foundation. We get it because we live it. Read our guide to finding a genuinely neuro-affirming specialist. Do I need an official diagnosis to start therapy? Absolutely not. We focus on your lived experiences, your challenges, and your strengths—not on labels. If you’re struggling with things like executive dysfunction, anxiety, or feeling overwhelmed, you are welcome here. Many of our clients are on their own journey of self-discovery. Read our manifesto on why your experience is valid, with or without a diagnosis. Ready to Ditch the Therapy-Speak? Look, we get it. Finding a therapist you actually vibe with is a huge deal. You shouldn’t have to pay for a full session just to find out if you’ll be understood. That’s why we start with a free, 15-minute “fit-check. ” Think of it as your chance to vet us, no strings attached. We’ll skip the clinical nonsense and just have a real conversation to see if our vibe matches your vibe. Pick a time below . Let’s do this. Need Help Right Now? Read this First.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
