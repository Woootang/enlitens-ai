For anyone who struggles with executive functions, “just do it” is the most useless and infuriating phrase in the English language. It’s like telling someone who is lost in the woods to “just find the path.” It’s a statement of such profound misunderstanding that it feels like a slap in the face. It’s not helpful because it completely misunderstands the nature of the problem. The problem is almost never a lack of desire or a failure of willpower. The problem is a specific, invisible bottleneck in a complex, multi-step cognitive process. Asking “why can’t you get started?” is a shame-based question that implies a character flaw. The right question, the scientifically-informed and compassionate question, is, “Where, precisely, is the signal getting lost?” The Cognitive Walk-Through is our proprietary method for answering that question. It is a forensic tool. We treat a “stuck” moment not as a personal failing, but as a crime scene. Our job is to put on our detective hats and collaboratively walk through the cognitive “replay footage” with our client to find the exact point where the system broke down. Asking “why can’t you get started?” only produces shame. The right question is, “Where, precisely, is the signal getting lost?” The Cognitive Assembly Line: A Forensic Protocol Imagine any task—from “doing the laundry” to “writing a report”—is a product being built on a complex assembly line in your brain’s prefrontal cortex (PFC) .. For the final product to be completed, the raw materials have to pass through several key stations in the correct order. The Cognitive Walk-Through is the process of inspecting each station to find the point of failure. The method is simple but powerful: You don’t ask about the task in general. You take one single, specific, real-world example of a task the client is stuck on, and you get microscopic. Station 1: The Blueprint (Planning & Organizing) Before the assembly line can even start, does the brain have a clear blueprint? A breakdown at this stage is an Organizing challenge. The Walk-Through Question: “Okay, you needed to clean the kitchen. Let’s pause the tape before you even moved. When you looked at the kitchen, what did your mind’s eye see? Was it a clear, step-by-step sequence—first the dishes, then the counters, then the floor? Or was it a single, overwhelming, chaotic image of ‘mess’ with no clear starting point?” The Forensic Insight: If the brain can’t generate a clear blueprint, the system is paralyzed by choice and ambiguity. The problem isn’t laziness; it’s a lack of a viable plan. Station 2: The Ignition Switch (Task Initiation) This is often the first and most common point of failure. The blueprint is perfect, the workers are ready, but someone has to turn the key. A breakdown here is an Activation challenge. The Walk-Through Question: “You’re standing in the kitchen. You see the mess. You even have a plan. Now, walk me through the next ten seconds in ultra-slow motion. What is the very first physical movement your body needs to make? Pick up a dish? Get the soap? Tell me about the feeling right at that ignition point. Is it a wall? A fog? A sudden, overwhelming urge to do something, anything, else?” The Forensic Insight: This is the moment where the brain’s dopamine-driven motivation system is supposed to engage. If that system is under-fueled, the “ignition” will fail, no matter how much willpower is applied. Station 3: The Conveyor Belt (Working Memory & Sequencing) Once the task is started, can the brain hold onto the sequence of steps and the overall goal? A breakdown here is a Working Memory or Focus challenge. The Walk-Through Question: “You’ve started the dishes. What is your brain thinking about while you’re washing the first plate? Is it thinking about the next step—drying the dishes? Or has it already jumped to thinking about that email you forgot to send, that conversation from yesterday, or the weird noise the car is making, causing the original task to fall off the conveyor belt?” The Forensic Insight: This reveals a struggle to hold and manipulate information online. The “factory floor” is chaotic, with new items constantly being thrown onto the conveyor belt, jamming the entire system. Station 4: The Quality Control Inspector (Self-Monitoring & Regulation) How does the brain handle frustration, boredom, or unexpected difficulty when the task gets hard? A breakdown here is an Emotion Regulation challenge. The Walk-Through Question: “You’ve been working for ten minutes, and now you’re at the boring, difficult part—scrubbing that burnt pan. Describe the ‘f*ck it’ feeling. What’s the story your brain tells you right then? ‘This is too hard,’ ‘I’ll finish it later,’ ‘This is good enough.’ Let’s get to know that voice. Is it a tired voice? An anxious voice? A shame-filled voice?” The Forensic Insight: This identifies that the bottleneck isn’t cognitive; it’s emotional. The brain’s management system is being hijacked by a dysregulated emotional state , leading it to abandon the project for a feeling of immediate relief. By walking through the process at this painfully slow, specific level, the true bottleneck is always revealed. And once you know exactly where the assembly line is breaking down, you can stop blaming the worker and start designing a precise, effective, and compassionate solution. Part of: The Clinical Model Hub | Explore the Full Enlitens Interview Model What's the difference between this and just "breaking down tasks"? “Breaking down tasks” is a good strategy, but it’s a generic one that often fails because it doesn’t diagnose the specific problem. It’s like telling someone whose car won’t start to “try driving it.” The Cognitive Walk-Through is the diagnostic process that comes first. It’s how you figure out if the problem is the blueprint (planning), the ignition (initiation), or the fuel line (motivation/dopamine). You can’t prescribe the right solution until you have the right diagnosis, and the Walk-Through is our diagnostic tool. This sounds like it could take a long time. Is it practical for a therapy session? It’s surprisingly fast once you get the hang of it, because you’re not analyzing their whole life. You are taking one single, specific example of a stuck point from their week. A five-minute Cognitive Walk-Through on “why I couldn’t get out of bed this morning” or “why I didn’t make that phone call” can yield more useful, actionable data than an entire session of talking about “procrastination” in the abstract. It is a tool of profound efficiency. Can clients learn to do this for themselves? Yes. That is the ultimate goal. The first few times, you act as the lead investigator, modeling the process of non-judgmental curiosity. Over time, you are teaching the client how to become the lead detective of their own brain. You are giving them a new internal monologue. Instead of the shame-based “Why am I so lazy?”, they learn to ask the curious, compassionate, and infinitely more useful question: “Okay, it looks like my ‘ignition switch’ is struggling right now. What’s one tiny thing I can do to get more dopamine and give it the fuel it needs?” Stop Guessing. Start Investigating. Understanding the precise nature of your executive function challenges is the first step to building a life that actually works for your brain.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up.
