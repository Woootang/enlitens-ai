After the Assessment: Now What? Liz Wooten LPC July 29, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here Imagine a master craftsman gives you a beautiful, custom-built toolkit. The tools are magnificent, perfectly weighted, and designed just for you. You take it home, place it on your clean workbench, and… you just look at it. You’re so in awe of the tools, so afraid of scratching them or using them the “wrong” way, that you never actually pick one up. You never build anything. The beautiful toolkit sits there, pristine and unused, a monument to potential. This is where so many of us are after a life-changing assessment. Your “User Manual” is that beautiful toolkit. You’ve read it a dozen times. You’re fascinated by it, you love it, you finally understand yourself. But you are so overwhelmed by the sheer potential, so terrified of implementing it imperfectly , that you’re stuck in a state of “analysis paralysis.” Our culture worships the perfect finished product and hides the messy process. We’re taught by a constant barrage of social media and self-help gurus that if we can’t do something perfectly the first time, we shouldn’t do it at all. This perfectionism is a cage. It is the enemy of all real progress, all real learning, and all real change. You are treating your User Manual like a sacred text to be studied behind glass. It is not. It is a messy, grease-stained workshop manual. It is meant to be highlighted, written in, dog-eared, tested, and even broken. The goal is not to execute the plan perfectly; the goal is to pick up one, single tool and get your hands dirty. We are not aiming for perfection; we are aiming for clumsy, beautiful momentum. You have permission to be a clumsy beginner. You have permission to try a strategy and have it fail. You have permission to get it “wrong.” Progress is not a straight line; it’s a series of messy, brilliant experiments. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is not to change your whole life tomorrow. Your mission is to make one thing one percent better. Open your User Manual. Find ONE —and only one—recommendation. Not the biggest one. Not the most important one. The easiest one. Try it, imperfectly, for one day. Maybe it’s putting a bowl by the door for your keys. Maybe it’s buying the noise-canceling headphones. That’s it. That’s the whole assignment. THE “WHAT TO SAY” SCRIPT (For Your Inner Critic) WHEN IT SAYS: “You’re not doing enough! This isn’t real change!” YOU SAY: “My only goal today is clumsy momentum. I am getting my hands dirty. That is all.” The journey does not start with a giant leap; it starts with a clumsy step. The goal of a Clarity Assessment is to give you the map, but the work of coaching and therapy is about taking that first, messy step with a guide by your side. Stop studying the map. It’s time to get some mud on your boots. Let’s go . Go Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole You Understand the "Why." Now the "How." The perfect next read for the person who has the map but needs help taking the first step on the journey. Read More A Lever, Not a Label. A reminder that your User Manual is not a sacred text, but a practical tool that is meant to be used . Read More The 15-Minute Vibe Check. The lowest-stakes “clumsy first step” you can take—a no-pressure call to talk about the journey ahead.

Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Need Help Right Now? Read this First. Okay, let’s take a breath. If you’ve scrolled down here because things feel like they’re on fire, I get it. I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It’s free, confidential, and always there. For Local St. Louis Crisis Help: We trust Behavioral Health Response (BHR) . They’re our top pick for local, trauma-informed support and can even send a mobile team to help.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
