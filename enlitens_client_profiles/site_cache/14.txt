It's not going to happen. They gave you a Burn Book full of your own “flaws.” We’ll help you build your own user manual. It’s way more fetch. Text Fit Check Now, Let's Make This the Easiest Part. The whole idea of being “assessed” probably makes your skin crawl. And it should. You’re likely picturing a cold, sterile room, a stranger with a clipboard asking you a million questions that don’t make sense, and a series of timed tests designed to measure all the ways you don’t measure up. You’re not wrong. The traditional assessment process is a masterclass in making human beings feel like lab rats. It’s a system built to find deficits, rooted in outdated science that compares you to a mythical “normal” person who doesn’t actually exist. It’s designed to give you a label , not a life. That is not what we do here. That’s not clarity. That’s a clinical receipt for your own perceived failings, and we’re not interested in writing them. We started Enlitens because we believe you deserve better than a pathologizing label and a four-figure bill. We Don’t Test. We Translate. Our Clarity Assessment isn’t a test you can pass or fail. There is no score, no grading, and no comparison to some mythical “normal” person. It is a guided, collaborative process where we act as your personal translators, helping you decode the unique language of your own nervous system. We operate on a simple belief: you are the world’s foremost expert on your own life. Our job isn’t to tell you who you are; it’s to provide the framework and the tools for you to tell us. We listen to your story, we explore your strengths, and we map out the real-world challenges you face. The entire goal is to co-create the one thing the traditional system never gives you: a “User Manual” for your brain. A practical, personalized, jargon-free guide that explains your unique wiring, honors your strengths, and gives you actionable strategies to build a life that actually fits you—not the other way around. Our Process: A Conversation in Three Acts. We’ve designed our entire process to feel more like a collaborative storytelling session than a clinical assessment. It’s a journey we take together, broken down into three simple, human-centered parts. Act I: The Story It all starts with you. We believe your lived experience is the most important data we have. In our first sessions, we’ll collaboratively map out your unique history using our Tiered Narrative Inquiry . We’re not looking for a clinical history; we’re looking to understand the world through your eyes and get a clean read on the core narratives of your Default Mode Network . Act II: The Discovery This is where we explore how your brain works. Using our gamified “Clarity Toolkit,” we’ll do a deep-dive into your cognitive strengths, your sensory profile, and the systems you use to manage your energy and attention. We use evidence-based tools like the Brown EF/A Scales and the Sensory Profile not as tests for a score, but as collaborative maps. It’s a playful, curiosity-driven process designed to find your superpowers, not just your struggles. Act III: The Roadmap The final step is delivering your “User Manual.” We’ll synthesize everything we’ve learned into a comprehensive, jargon-free guide to your own neurology. This is a collaborative, “aha!” moment where we connect all the dots together. It’s a living document, full of personalized insights and actionable strategies that you can start using immediately to build a life that honors your wiring. This Isn’t One-Size-Fits-All. Find Your Playbook. Our core process is always the same—a collaborative, strengths-based conversation. But the focus of our work changes depending on where you are in your journey. Select the stage that feels most like you to see how we tailor our approach to your unique context. The Discoverer (Child & Teen): This is for kids, teens, and their parents. It’s for when you first realize the rulebook everyone else got just doesn’t apply. We focus on building a foundational language for emotions and strengths, and on navigating the world of school, friendships, and IEPs with confidence. The Architect (Young Adult): This is for college students and those in their 20s. You’re the architect of your own life now, and it can feel like you’re building without blueprints. We focus on creating systems for independence, managing academic and early-career demands, and building an authentic identity from the ground up. The Navigator (Adult & Late Discovery): This is for established adults who have hit a wall. Whether it’s burnout from a lifetime of masking or a late discovery that reframes your entire past, your journey isn’t over. We focus on helping you re-chart your course with your new self-knowledge, whether that means pivoting in your career or redefining your relationships. You Don’t Walk Away with a Label. You Walk Away with a Field Guide to Yourself. The endpoint of a traditional assessment is usually a dense, 20-page PDF that feels like it was written in another language. It’s a list of your deficits, stamped with a clinical label, and handed over with a shrug. It’s a dead end. Our process ends with a beginning. You receive your “User Manual”—a comprehensive, personalized, and profoundly practical guide to your own neurology. It’s written in plain English, for you. Inside your guide, you’ll find: A detailed map of your innate cognitive strengths and superpowers. An overview of your unique operating system—from your interest-based motivation to your specific sensory needs. A toolkit of personalized, actionable strategies and accommodations for home, school, or work. Language and frameworks to help you better understand and advocate for yourself. This is more than a report. It’s your roadmap. It’s the evidence you need to stop blaming yourself and the permission you deserve to start building a life that truly fits.

Explore the Path What will I actually receive after my Clarity Assessment? Instead of a confusing clinical report, you get a personalized “User Manual” for your brain. This is a comprehensive, strengths-based guide written in plain English that details your unique cognitive profile and provides a toolkit of practical, real-world strategies you can use immediately . How long does the entire assessment process take, and what does the scheduling look like? We’ve designed the process to be flexible to fit your life, not the other way around. The entire Clarity Assessment, from start to finish, typically takes between 2 and 7 hours , and we offer two main paths depending on your needs: The Integrated Path: If you’re looking to start therapy with us, we can weave the assessment directly into our initial sessions. We’ll dedicate parts of our weekly 1-hour appointments to the discovery process over a few weeks, allowing us to build your “User Manual” collaboratively while we build our therapeutic relationship. The Deep-Dive Path: If you’re focused solely on getting clarity quickly, we can schedule a dedicated, longer session (usually 2-3 hours) to complete the main discovery work all at once. We then schedule a separate 1-1.5 hour follow-up session to go over your “User Manual” in detail. Can I use my "User Manual" for official accommodations at work or school? Our Clarity Assessment is designed to give you profound self-understanding and practical life strategies. While the “User Manual” is an incredibly powerful tool for self-advocacy, it is not a traditional diagnostic report designed to satisfy insurance or institutional requirements. We focus on providing answers for you , not just labels for them. Do I need to be in St. Louis, or can I do the assessment via telehealth? The conversational nature of our Clarity Assessment makes it perfectly suited for telehealth . We can conduct all our sessions securely online, making the process accessible to anyone in Missouri , regardless of your location. Who is the ideal candidate for a Clarity Assessment vs. traditional testing? Our assessment is ideal for those who feel misunderstood by previous therapists or who suspect the standard labels don’t fit their experience. If you’re seeking deep self-understanding and a “why” behind your brain’s wiring, rather than just a formal label for insurance, our collaborative process is a great fit. What happens after I get my "User Manual"? Am I done? Getting your User Manual is often the beginning, not the end! It’s the roadmap we can then use in ongoing therapy or coaching to help you build real-world skills and strategies. Many clients continue with us to put their new insights into practice.

I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
