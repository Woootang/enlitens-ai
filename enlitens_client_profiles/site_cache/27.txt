If you’ve scrolled down here because things feel like they’re on fire, I get it. I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
