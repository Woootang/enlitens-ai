The $3,500 Answer: Why is Autism & ADHD Testing So Fucking Expensive in St Liz Wooten LPC July 28, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here Let’s call it what it is: a f*cking ransom. The idea that you have to pay the equivalent of three months’ rent to get the answers your child needs to survive and thrive is not a healthcare model. It is an act of systemic violence against working families. It is a gate built to keep people out. And we are here to burn the gate to the ground. So you pick up the extra shift at the restaurant. You start driving for Uber on the weekends. You cancel the family vacation you were trying to save up for. You put off fixing the car again. You do this because you are a parent, and you would do anything for your kid. You are sacrificing your own well-being, your own sleep, and your own peace of mind to pay a price that feels deeply, fundamentally wrong in your gut. Why is it so expensive? Because the system is designed that way. It’s built on a foundation of insurance companies that refuse to adequately cover these assessments, creating a cash-pay Wild West where large hospital systems and psychology practices can charge whatever desperate families are willing to pay. They leverage your fear and your love, and they call it healthcare. The average cost of a private autism assessment in the St. Louis metro area can range from $1,500 to over $5,000, while the median household income is just over $70,000. For a single parent, that can represent more than a month of their gross income. The Assessment Cash Grab: A business model where a high price is used as a false signifier of quality, leveraging a parent’s desperation to justify inflated fees for services that do not need to cost that much. The myth is that more expensive equals more thorough. The reality is you are often just paying for institutional bloat and brand names. “Your child’s health and future should not be a luxury item. Life-changing clarity should not be reserved for the wealthy. We are at war with any system that puts a price tag on a child’s well-being.” You have been led to believe that this is the only way, that this is just “what it costs.” This is a lie. We are not just a “more affordable option.” We are an active, ethical rebellion against this entire model. Our Clarity Assessment was designed from the ground up to be accessible, transparent, and clinically unimpeachable. We deconstructed the bloated, unnecessary testing batteries and built a streamlined process that respects your time, your energy, and your wallet. We are proving that you can provide exceptional, affirming care without extorting the families you serve. Your child’s future should not be for sale. You do not have to set yourself on fire to keep your child warm. You do not have to participate in a system that is preying on you. There is another way.

I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It’s free, confidential, and always there. For Local St. Louis Crisis Help: We trust Behavioral Health Response (BHR) . They’re our top pick for local, trauma-informed support and can even send a mobile team to help.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
