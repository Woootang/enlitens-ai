Always. (Our “No Hard Feelings” Promise). Trust Your Gut. Always. (Our "No Hard Feelings" Promise) Liz Wooten LPC July 29, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here Let’s talk about the specific, sinking feeling of being profoundly misunderstood in a space that promised you acceptance. It’s a feeling of profound dissonance, like a single, jarring off-key note in an otherwise perfect chord. You’re sitting across from a well-meaning therapist in a carefully curated, “accepting” space—maybe a cool office in The Grove, surrounded by local art—and you realize, with a quiet horror, that they don’t actually get it . They love your “quirky” creative side, but when you try to explain the crushing exhaustion of social masking, their eyes glaze over. You feel it in your body first. A tightening in your chest. Your nervous system is screaming, “This isn’t safe.” But your brain, conditioned by a lifetime of being told you’re “too sensitive,” starts to gaslight you. Am I being too difficult? They’re an expert. I should trust them, not me. And so you stay, trying to force a connection that isn’t there, which is one of the loneliest feelings on earth. Your “Vibe Check” is a High-Fidelity Data Stream That “gut feeling” is not a mystical whim or you being “too sensitive.” It is your nervous system’s neuroception processing millions of bits of relational data in an instant. It is the most sophisticated diagnostic tool in the room. Here’s the hard science. According to Polyvagal Theory , your body is constantly, subconsciously scanning for cues of safety or danger. For a creative, intuitive person—especially one with a history of being misunderstood—your system is like a high-resolution sensor. You pick up on the subtle data points others might miss: a dismissive micro-expression, a shift in tone, a well-intentioned but fundamentally clueless piece of advice. When your neuroception detects these cues, it triggers a defensive state. It’s not in your head; it’s a biological reality. Your intuition about a therapist is not a feeling to be questioned; it is a high-fidelity data stream from your nervous system about the presence or absence of safety. Decades of clinical research have proven what your body already knows: the therapeutic alliance —that felt sense of safety, trust, and connection—is the single greatest predictor of whether therapy will actually work. It’s more important than any specific modality or credential. Honoring your gut isn’t just a philosophy; it is the most evidence-based practice we have. We are clinically obligated to trust your data. Our “No Hard Feelings” Promise Because that data is so critical, we have a simple, absolute promise. If you finish your first session, or your fifth, and your gut tells you that I am not the right fit for the next leg of your journey, I need you to tell me. You will be met with zero offense. Zero guilt. Zero passive-aggression. You will be met with my profound respect for your self-awareness and my gratitude for your honesty. Then, I will open up my own professional network and actively help you find a trusted referral to a specialist who might be a better fit. Your well-being is more important to me than your business. You are the creative director here. You are never stuck. Your gut is in charge. Always.

I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It’s free, confidential, and always there. For Local St. Louis Crisis Help: We trust Behavioral Health Response (BHR) . They’re our top pick for local, trauma-informed support and can even send a mobile team to help.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
