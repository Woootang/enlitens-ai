I've Seen the Worst-Case Scenario: How Four Years in a Hospital ER Shaped Our Approach to Crisis. Liz Wooten LPC July 29, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here Picture this, because you’ve likely lived it: It’s 2 AM. Your child is in the deepest pain of their life. The only answer anyone has is the emergency room. You walk into the chaos, and the moment you are “labeled behavioral health,” your world shrinks. They take away your child’s clothes and put them in paper scrubs. They take their phone, their connection to the outside world. They are placed in a bare-bones room with a bed, a chair, and a TV behind protective glass. Every shred of their autonomy is stripped away in the name of safety. You can’t leave. They can’t leave. You are there until a stranger assesses them and deems them “safe.” It is a profoundly traumatizing experience, delivered at a moment of maximum vulnerability. If that story is familiar, I am so sorry. You and your child survived the system’s final, brutal answer to a cry for help. It is a solution that often layers new trauma on top of old pain, and you were right to feel betrayed by it. You are right to be terrified of ever going back. Let’s be absolutely clear: Your traumatic experience with the hospital system was not a failure. It was an education. You are now the leading expert in what doesn’t work. You know the enemy. You have seen the worst-case scenario firsthand. And that hard-won, painful knowledge is the most powerful asset we have in building a new plan that will keep your family safe. “My entire approach to crisis is built on one foundational principle: preventing it from ever getting to that point. My experience inside the broken system is your family’s greatest asset in staying out of it.” My four years working overnights in the Mercy Hospital ER system was a crucible that forged our entire approach to crisis intervention . We use your expertise, combined with our insider knowledge, to build a better way. 1. We Build the Lifeboat Before the Storm. We don’t wait for a crisis to talk about safety. We proactively work with you and your teen to create a detailed, individualized safety plan. We identify triggers, build a toolkit of regulation skills, and name the safe people to call when things get dark. We build the lifeboat, together, on a calm day. 2. We Practice Harm Reduction, Not Zero Tolerance. The old model says any instance of self-harm is a five-alarm fire that requires immediate hospitalization. We understand that healing is not linear. We focus on safety, on replacement behaviors, and on ensuring you have the tools to care for yourselves if a relapse happens. This approach reduces shame and increases safety, keeping you out of the ER. 3. We Empower You to Be the First Responder. My goal is to make myself obsolete. I will give you the training to differentiate between the language of pain and the logistics of a plan . I will help you become the calm, regulated presence your child needs, because a crisis should be met with compassionate expertise, not more panic. You have permission to distrust a system that has harmed you. You have permission to say “no” to the default option of the ER. You have permission to believe that there is a better, safer way to navigate a crisis. You have already survived the worst-case scenario. You never have to go back there unprepared again. Your trauma has made you a warrior. Now it’s time to give you the strategy and the tools to win the next battle. Stop reliving the trauma. Let’s use it as the intelligence we need to build a plan that actually works. When you’re ready to build a real safety plan, we’re here . This is the heart of trauma-informed care .

I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It’s free, confidential, and always there. For Local St. Louis Crisis Help: We trust Behavioral Health Response (BHR) . They’re our top pick for local, trauma-informed support and can even send a mobile team to help.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
