A Guide to Self-Advocacy Liz Wooten LPC July 29, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here The email sits in your inbox, forwarded from your academic advisor. “Contact the Disability Resource Center.” Your stomach plummets. It feels like being called to the principal’s office. You have a brand-new diagnosis, and now you’re supposed to walk into an official-looking office and… what? Confess your “brokenness”? Beg for help? Perform a perfect monologue about your struggles that will convince a stranger to believe you? “What do I even say? What if they don’t believe me? What if I ask for the ‘wrong’ thing? Everyone else can handle this, why can’t I? Maybe I should just try to get by without it. It’s too much.” Let’s be clear: You are not going in there to ask for a favor. You are a highly skilled expert on your own neurology, armed with a data-rich, professionally prepared report. You are walking into a strategic consultation to co-design your educational environment. You are not the student being called to the office; you are the lead consultant on the project of your own success. A good neuro-affirming assessment doesn’t just give you a label; it gives you a “User Manual for Your Brain.” This is your weapon, your map, and your script for the quest ahead. It contains three critical components: The “Why” (The Science): A clear, jargon-free explanation of your brain’s unique wiring, providing the scientific rationale for your needs. The “What” (The Data): Specific, documented examples of your strengths (e.g., hyperfocus, pattern recognition) and your challenges (e.g., auditory processing, task initiation). The “How” (The Accommodations Menu): A concrete, pre-written list of recommended accommodations tied directly to the data, such as “extended time on tests due to processing speed” or “access to lecture notes to support working memory challenges.” This is the document that allows you to walk into the resource center at SLU or UMSL fully prepared. THE “WHAT TO SAY” SCRIPT (Your Opening Email) Subject: Newly Diagnosed Student – Request for Accommodation Meeting Body: “Dear [Name of DRC Coordinator], My name is [Your Name], and I am a [Your Year] student. I have recently been diagnosed with [e.g., ADHD, Autism Spectrum], and my assessment report outlines several recommended academic accommodations. Could you please let me know the process for scheduling a meeting to establish a formal accommodation plan? I have attached a copy of my diagnostic report for your review. Thank you, [Your Name] [Student ID Number]” You feel like a scared kid being sent to the principal’s office. This is a lie your anxiety is telling you. You are a well-prepared expert with a detailed technical manual, arriving to instruct the support staff on how to best interface with your specific operating system. You are not asking for help; you are providing instructions. You have permission to need help. You have permission to ask for it. You have permission to use tools that make your life more accessible. Your intelligence is not measured by how much you can suffer. Stop seeing this as a terrifying performance. See it as a quest you are uniquely prepared for. You have the map. You have the tools. You are the expert on your own experience. When you’re ready to get your “User Manual” and start your quest , we’re here to be your guide. Go Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole A Lever, Not a Label. A manifesto on why your “User Manual” is a tool to open doors, not a box to trap you in. Read More The Imposter Syndrome Manifesto. A guide to fighting the voice in your head that whispers, “Maybe you’re just faking it and don’t deserve this.” Read More The 15-Minute Vibe Check.

Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Need Help Right Now? Read this First. Okay, let’s take a breath. If you’ve scrolled down here because things feel like they’re on fire, I get it. I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It’s free, confidential, and always there. For Local St. Louis Crisis Help: We trust Behavioral Health Response (BHR) . They’re our top pick for local, trauma-informed support and can even send a mobile team to help.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
