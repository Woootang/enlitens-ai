The traditional mental health system is built on a foundation of financial mystery and shame. Practices often hide their prices, use confusing billing codes, and make you feel like a burden for asking the most important question: “Can I even afford this?” That is intentional. And it is bulls*hit. At Enlitens, we believe that financial transparency is a non-negotiable part of ethical, trauma-informed care. You cannot feel safe in a therapeutic relationship if you are constantly terrified of the bill. So let’s pull back the curtain and talk about it, directly and with no shame. Your Financial Reality is Real, and We See It. We live in the same world you do. We know that student loan debt is a crippling, ever-present reality. We know that the “ADHD tax” —the real money lost to late fees, forgotten subscriptions, and impulse purchases—is already a strain on your budget. We know that navigating the American healthcare system is a soul-crushing, full-time job that seems designed to make you give up. You’ve been made to feel like your inability to afford a $3,500 assessment or $250-an-hour therapy sessions is a personal failure. It’s not. It’s the predictable outcome of a broken system that prioritizes profit over people. You are not a walking dollar sign. You are a human being who deserves access to high-quality care, regardless of your income. Your financial situation is a valid and important part of your story, and we will always treat it with respect. Why It’s So Fucked Up: A Rebellion Against Predatory Practices Our financial model is a direct rebellion against the standard operating procedure in mental health. We’ve seen firsthand how the system is rigged, and we refuse to participate. The Assessment “Cash Grab” It’s an open secret in the therapy world that traditional psychological testing is often treated as a high-profit “cash grab.” Practices buy expensive, pre-packaged test kits, administer them in a cold, robotic way, and charge thousands of dollars for a confusing, jargon-filled report that offers no real-world solutions. It is an exploitative model that profits from a parent’s desperation and an adult’s search for answers. The Insurance Shell Game We also want to be radically transparent about the state of the health insurance industry. Many major insurance companies have created massive, intentional barriers to care. They have slammed their panels shut to new therapists, created absurd credentialing delays that can last for years, and have slashed reimbursement rates to levels that are simply not sustainable for a small practice that prioritizes high-quality, individualized care over a high-volume, “churn-and-burn” model. This isn’t a secret problem; it’s a systemic crisis designed to maximize their profits at the expense of your well-being. Our Model: People Over Profit. Period. We have built our practice on a different philosophy. Our goal is to make exceptional care accessible, not to squeeze every possible dollar out of you. Here is our entire financial structure, laid out in plain English. Clarity Assessments: Transparent & Accessible Our Rate: We charge a simple, transparent $100 per hour for all assessment-related work—the interview, the scoring, and the report writing. A typical, comprehensive assessment takes between 3-7 hours from start to finish. No hidden material fees. No bulls*hit. Our Promise: We know that even this can be a stretch. We will never let cost be the sole reason you can’t get answers. We are absolutely committed to working with you to create a flexible payment plan or an adjusted schedule that makes sense for your unique financial situation. Therapy & Coaching: A Simple Sliding Scale The Tiers: For ongoing therapy, we use a straightforward sliding scale: $50, $75, or $100 per session. The Process: During our Fit Check, we will have a real, no-judgment conversation to figure out which tier is sustainable for you. That’s it. No complicated forms, no need to show us your pay stubs. Just an honest conversation. A Note on Using Your Insurance Because every insurance plan has its own weird quirks, a static list of logos on a website is more confusing than helpful. Instead, we are committed to a simple, human-to-human conversation. The Fit Check is Your Clearinghouse: In our free, 15-minute Fit Check, we can verify your specific plan in real-time. We will tell you directly if we are in-network and what your benefits look like. Out-of-Network (Superbills): If we’re not in-network, we will explain exactly how to use your out-of-network benefits. We’ll provide you with a monthly “superbill” that you can submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement, and we will walk you through that process. Explore the Full Enlitens Interview Model You're very open about other practices being a "cash grab." How do I know you're actually different? Because our entire model is built to be the opposite. A “cash grab” assessment is a high-volume, low-transparency operation. We charge a simple, transparent hourly rate so you only pay for the time we actually spend working for you. Our philosophy is built on social justice and accessibility, not on maximizing profit. Our rebellion is in our business model itself. Read more about the exorbitant cost of testing in St. Louis. What is a "superbill" and is it actually worth the hassle? A superbill is a detailed, coded receipt of our sessions that you can submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement. We’ll be honest: whether it’s “worth it” depends entirely on your specific out-of-network benefits. We are committed to helping you do the math so you can make an informed choice. Learn more about our People Over Profit philosophy. Why do you offer a sliding scale for therapy but not a set one for assessments? It’s a great question that comes down to the difference in the work. Therapy is an ongoing relationship where a sustainable fee is crucial. Assessments are a short-term project where the time required can vary. A transparent $100 hourly rate is the fairest method, but our commitment to accessibility is the same. We are 100% committed to creating flexible payment plans to ensure the cost is not a barrier. If I use the sliding scale, do I have to prove my income? It feels shameful. Absolutely not. The shame and judgment that come with conversations about money are part of the broken system we’re dismantling. Our sliding scale is built on trust and mutual respect. We will have a brief, no-judgment conversation to determine a sustainable rate. We trust you to be honest, and you can trust us to be compassionate. Do my insurance benefits cover telehealth sessions the same way they cover in-person sessions? In almost all cases today, the answer is yes. Since 2020, the vast majority of insurance plans have updated their policies to cover telehealth and in-person mental health services at the same rate. However, every plan has its own quirks, which is why we insist on a direct conversation to verify your specific benefits. I’m worried about surprise bills. How do you ensure that doesn't happen? We have a simple, non-negotiable policy: You will never receive a surprise bill from us. Period. Your rate will be clearly established and agreed upon before your first appointment. For assessments, we will give you a clear, good-faith estimate of the total expected hours. Financial surprises are re-traumatizing and unethical. We don’t do them. The First Step is Always Free. The goal of this page is to remove the fear and uncertainty around the cost of care so you can make an empowered decision. You deserve to know what you’re getting into, and you deserve a partner who is willing to have an honest conversation about the financial realities of therapy. That honest conversation starts with the free, 15-minute Fit Check. Book a Free Fit Check Need Help Right Now? Read this First. Okay, let’s take a breath.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
