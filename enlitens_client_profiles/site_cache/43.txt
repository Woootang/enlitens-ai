Liz Wooten LPC July 29, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here Let’s get one thing straight. That persistent, gut-level certainty that you are one missed deadline away from being exposed as a complete and utter fraud has nothing to do with your competence. It’s not a lack of discipline. It’s not laziness. It is not “imposter syndrome.” It is the single most important piece of diagnostic data your nervous system can produce. It is a critical error message blinking in all caps: SYSTEM INCOMPATIBILITY. It is the logical, predictable result of forcing a powerful, specialized operating system—your brain—to run cheap, bloated, inefficient software—the neurotypical corporate world. You’ve been sold a lie. A toxic, shame-based piece of corporate dogma that says if you’re not thriving, you’re not trying. That if you can’t effortlessly handle the soul-crushing administrative bulls*hit between the moments of brilliant, deep work, you are the one who is broken. So you come to us thinking you need to be fixed. You believe you need an official diagnostic label, a permission slip from the system, before you’re even allowed to ask for help. That is the biggest lie of all. Your Brain Isn’t a Flawed PC; It’s a High-Performance Mac The mental health industrial complex wants to treat you like a buggy Windows PC. It wants to run its clunky, one-size-fits-all diagnostic software, find the “error,” and slap on a patch. But what if you’re not a buggy PC? What if you’re a Mac, and they’ve been trying to run .exe files on you your entire goddamn life? The problem was never your hardware. It was the profound, soul-crushing incompatibility of the software you were forced to run. This isn’t a metaphor; it’s neuroscience. Your brain is a prediction engine , optimized for complex, high-interest problem-solving. It thrives on the dopamine hit of a novel challenge. But the mind-numbing, bureaucratic tasks of corporate life—the endless status meetings, the repetitive expense reports, the political small talk—generate no positive prediction error. Your brain, in its infinite wisdom, correctly identifies these tasks as a low-value waste of processing power and diverts resources. What the world calls “procrastination” is actually your high-performance brain’s elegant, efficient refusal to waste energy on bulls*hit. The burnout you’re experiencing is the thermal heat of your processor being forced to run a constant, draining emulation of a neurotypical employee. The feeling of being an “imposter” is the logical conclusion of a specialist who has been forced to pass as a generalist their entire life. It is not a feeling; it is an accurate assessment of the situation. Your New Mission: Stop Fixing the Hardware, Start Debugging the Software Your mission is no longer to try harder to be a “normal” employee. Your new mission is to become a systems analyst for your own brilliant mind. You don’t need a diagnosis to begin this work. A diagnosis is just one possible output of the process; it is not the price of admission. The data we need isn’t in a diagnostic manual. It’s in your lived experience. Your burnout is the data. Your “imposter syndrome” is the data. Your list of failed productivity hacks is the data. This is the entire purpose of the Clarity Assessment . It’s not a test to see if you’re “broken.” It’s a systems diagnostic. We sit down with you and we look at the error logs. We identify the exact points of friction between your native OS and the software the world is forcing you to run. We map out your unique challenges with executive functions and build a custom user manual that honors your hardware instead of fighting it. You are not a fraud. You are a specialist who has been handed the wrong tools. Stop waiting for permission to get the right ones. It’s time to start the journey of making your work life right .

I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It’s free, confidential, and always there. For Local St. Louis Crisis Help: We trust Behavioral Health Response (BHR) . They’re our top pick for local, trauma-informed support and can even send a mobile team to help.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
