Liz Wooten LPC August 5, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here You’re at a gallery opening on Cherokee Street. The music is too loud, the lights are too bright, and you’re running the social script on a loop. You mention how the sensory overload is exhausting, and a friend—a good, well-meaning friend—says, “Oh, I get that. My social anxiety is so bad too.” And the world just… stops. Because you know, in your bones, that’s not it. It’s not the same. You feel profoundly, utterly alone, your reality dismissed and misunderstood even in a space that claims to celebrate difference. The lie you’ve been told, and have started to believe, is that your needs make you unlovable. That this exhaustion you feel is just a more dramatic form of social anxiety. That isn’t just wrong; it’s scientifically inaccurate. A landmark 2025 study published in the journal Autism has provided the definitive, statistical proof of what you’ve always known: Autistic masking and social anxiety are not the same thing. One is a feeling. The other is a highly skilled, cognitively demanding, full-time job you’ve been forced to work your entire life. The Science: Drawing a Line in the Sand For years, the clinical world has struggled to untangle these overlapping experiences. So, a team of researchers led by Dr. McKinnon set out to answer the question once and for all: Is camouflaging a real, distinct psychological construct, or is it just a fancy name for social anxiety? They focused their study on the undisputed world experts on the topic: a large sample of majority-female, self-identified autistic adults. They administered a series of questionnaires, including the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q), and then ran the data through a powerful statistical analysis called an Exploratory Factor Analysis. Think of it like this: the researchers put all the data points into a design program and told it to group them by their true nature. The data for “hiding your traits” and “performing neurotypicality” snapped together into one clean layer, while “fear of judgment” created its own, completely separate layer. The results were a stunning victory for validation. The analysis proved, with statistical certainty, that camouflaging is a distinct psychological construct, completely separate from social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation. While the two experiences are absolutely related—and for many, masking causes anxiety—they are not the same thing. Why This Nuance is Everything The study also exposed the limitations of even our best tools. It found that some items on the questionnaire were statistically messy, proving that a tool is only as good as the clinician wielding it. A lazy clinician sees the behavior—avoiding a party—and calls it “anxiety.” A great clinician gets curious about the why . Are you avoiding the party because you’re terrified of being judged (anxiety)? Or are you avoiding it because you’ve done the math and realized the massive energy cost of masking for three hours will leave you with a two-day “social hangover” (a strategic, autistic energy-conservation measure)? The behavior is the same. The “why” is everything. Your experience is real. A Guide to Masking is not just another word for anxiety. It is a unique, complex, and exhausting skillset you developed to survive. You deserve a specialist who doesn’t just see the behavior, but who has the clinical nuance to understand the “why” behind it. When you’re ready to Start , we’re here. The science finally proves you were right all along. Go Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole The Crisis in Autism Testing The confusion between masking and anxiety is made worse by flawed diagnostic tools. This 2025 study exposes the crisis in autism assessment.

I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
