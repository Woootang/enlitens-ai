Liz Wooten LPC July 29, 2025 By Liz Wooten, LPC About the Author: Liz Wooten, LPC, is the founder of Enlitens and a rebellious academic dedicated to dismantling the broken mental health system. As an AuDHD therapist with years of front-line crisis experience, she brings a deep, lived understanding to her work. Read Liz’s Full Story Here Your child is in crisis. You finally made the call to get them an assessment—the first concrete step toward getting answers and help. And the receptionist on the other end of the line, with a polite, practiced calm that felt like a slap in the face, told you the wait for a new patient appointment is eight months. Maybe twelve. Maybe eighteen. Eight months. While right now , your child is having daily after-school meltdowns that shake the whole house. While right now , their grades are in a free fall, and every email from the school feels like a body blow. While right now , you are lying awake every single night from midnight to 4 AM, sick with a terror you can’t even name, scrolling your phone for an answer that isn’t there. Let’s call this what it is: Institutional negligence. The mental healthcare system has so completely normalized its own collapse that it can tell a parent in an active, five-alarm fire crisis to take a number and wait in a year-long line, and act like that is a reasonable response. It is not. It is a profound moral and systemic failure. Your child’s crisis is happening in real-time, and a solution that is a year away is not a solution at all. According to the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey, rates of persistent sadness and suicidal ideation among adolescents have increased by nearly 40% in the last decade. The crisis is now. The response must be now. You do not have to accept this. We refuse to accept this. Our entire assessment process was designed as a rebellion against this broken, unresponsive model. We believe an assessment is not a passive measurement for a future date; it is an active, urgent, therapeutic intervention that needs to begin now . “Telling a family in crisis to wait eight months for help is not a logistical problem; it is an ethical failure. We have architected our entire process to be the answer to that failure.” We dismantled the rigid, bureaucratic model and built one for the real world. Here’s how: We Start Now: We can typically begin the intake and initial data-gathering process within one to two weeks, not eight months. This provides immediate relief and a sense of forward momentum. We Break It Down: We don’t force you and your child into a single, exhausting 4-hour testing block. We break the assessment into smaller, 60-90 minute sessions that can be scheduled flexibly around your life and your child’s capacity. We Front-Load the Support: The process itself is therapeutic. You get support, resources, and strategies from the very first session. You don’t have to wait until the final report to start getting help. Your child’s crisis cannot wait for a broken system to get its act together. You do not have to stand in that year-long line, feeling your hope curdle into despair. There is a better way. Stop waiting for the system to save you. Start the process now . Go Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole I've Seen the Worst-Case Scenario.

I’ve been in the ER with clients and their families in those moments, and my first priority is always safety—in the least restrictive way possible. If this is a life-threatening emergency —if you have acted on a plan or are about to—your only job right now is to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room. Full stop. We can figure out the rest later. If it’s not a 911-level emergency but you still need to talk to a human right now , here are your best, most direct options: For National 24/7 Support: Call or Text 988 anytime, anywhere in the US, to connect with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It’s free, confidential, and always there. For Local St. Louis Crisis Help: We trust Behavioral Health Response (BHR) . They’re our top pick for local, trauma-informed support and can even send a mobile team to help.

Take one second. That’s all I’m asking. Do not try to “calm down.” Do not try to “fix it.” Do not listen to the voice screaming that you need to do something right now . Just be here, with me, for one single breath. My name is Liz. I’ve spent years working overnight in the ER, sitting with people on what was often the worst night of their entire lives. I have sat in the eye of the hurricane, and I can tell you with absolute certainty that the chaos you feel right now is not the truth. It is a storm in your nervous system. And a storm is just a weather pattern. It is not you. It is not permanent. And you do not have to navigate it alone. Right now, your brain’s alarm system is screaming. The logical part of your brain has been taken offline. That is a normal, brilliant, biological survival response. But you and I are going to bring it back online, together. We are going to do one, simple, physical thing. This is not a bulls*hit mindfulness exercise. This is a direct, manual override for your nervous system. Place your hand on your chest. Can you feel that? The rise and fall. The rhythm. That is the anchor. That is the proof that you are here, in this moment, and you are alive. Keep your hand there. Now, we are going to make one choice. The storm is telling you there are a million overwhelming things you have to do. That is a lie. There are only three choices right now, and you only need to pick one. If you or someone else is in immediate, physical danger and you need help on site, right now: This is the button you push when you need the paramedics or the police to show up. This is the “bring the fire truck” button. Call 911 Now If you are having thoughts of suicide and you need to talk or text with a human, right now: This is the national, 24/7 lifeline. It is free, it is confidential, and it is staffed by trained counselors who are ready to listen without judgment. This is the “I need a lifeline” button. Call or Text the 988 Lifeline If you are in St. Louis, you are not in crisis but you are in deep distress and need to talk to someone local: Behavioral Health Response (BHR) is our community’s lifeline. They provide free, confidential telephone counseling and can connect you with local resources. This is the “I need a local guide” button. Call BHR St. Louis
