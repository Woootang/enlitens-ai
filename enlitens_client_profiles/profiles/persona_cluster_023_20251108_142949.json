  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Often felt like she was 'performing' to fit in. Parents, while loving, didn't quite understand her intense emotions and sensitivities, often dismissing them as 'being dramatic.' Stability was present, but emotional attunement was lacking. Overachieving was rewarded, leading to a constant pressure to excel.",
    "adolescence": "The pressure to succeed intensified during adolescence. Social situations became increasingly fraught with anxiety, leading to isolation and masking behaviors. Started experiencing depressive episodes, which were often attributed to 'teen angst.' Developed hyper-focus on specific interests as a coping mechanism. Experimented with substances to self-medicate anxiety.",
    "early_adulthood": "Early adulthood brought increased responsibilities and expectations, leading to burnout. College was a mix of academic success and social isolation. Relationships were difficult to navigate, marked by intense emotions and communication challenges. Started to seriously question her identity and whether she truly knew herself under the layers of masking.",
    "family_structure": "Grew up in a nuclear family, with both parents present. One or two siblings, often high-achieving and seemingly 'well-adjusted,' which further fueled feelings of inadequacy. Some clients are now single moms, some are navigating complex relationship dynamics after divorce.",

May have switched majors or taken breaks due to mental health challenges. Intense pressure to succeed and meet parental expectations, especially as Asian-American children of immigrants.",

      "The ending of a significant relationship, forcing her to confront her own needs and patterns.",
      "Starting therapy and beginning the process of self-discovery.",
      "The birth of her child, shifting priorities and revealing capacity for deep love."
    ],
    "intergenerational_patterns": "Possible undiagnosed neurodivergence in parents, leading to a lack of understanding and support. Generational trauma related to immigration and cultural assimilation. Pattern of prioritizing achievement over emotional well-being."

    ],
    "diagnosis_journey": "Suspected she was different for a long time, but dismissed it or didn't have the language to explain it. Researched Autism/ADHD independently and experienced a profound sense of recognition. Faced skepticism from some medical professionals before finally receiving a formal diagnosis in adulthood. The diagnosis process was validating but also brought up grief for the years spent struggling without understanding.",
    "how_it_shows_up": "Executive dysfunction impacts daily tasks, leading to feelings of guilt and shame. Sensory sensitivities cause overwhelm and anxiety in certain environments. Difficulty with social cues and communication leads to misunderstandings and isolation. Intense emotions and difficulty regulating them. Masking behaviors contribute to burnout and a sense of disconnect from her true self. Gender dysphoria and confusion around gender identity add another layer of complexity.",
    "nervous_system_pattern": "Highly sensitive nervous system that is easily overwhelmed. Tends to fluctuate between hyper-arousal and hypo-arousal. Seeks sensory input to regulate, but can easily become overstimulated. Difficulty with interoception, making it hard to identify and respond to her own needs.",

    "sensory_profile": "Highly sensitive to noise, bright lights, and strong smells. Prefers soft, comfortable clothing. Can become easily overwhelmed by crowded or chaotic environments. Seeks out sensory input like weighted blankets or fidget toys to regulate. Proprioceptive input (e.g., hugs, firm pressure) is often calming.",
    "food_sensory_details": "Dislikes foods with mixed textures, like casseroles or stews. Avoids anything slimy or with visible fat. Safe foods include plain Cheerios (must be crunchy), specific brand of white cheddar cheese crackers (Kraft only), grilled chicken (must be room temperature, no sauce), and rice (basmati only). Notices herself binge eating on crunchy textures when stressed. Often skips meals when overwhelmed or hyper-focused."
