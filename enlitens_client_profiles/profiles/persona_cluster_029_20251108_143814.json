Her parents valued academic achievement, and while loving, they struggled to understand her distractibility and frequent disorganization. Her room was always a mess, and she frequently lost things, leading to frustration and scolding.",

She has brought this up to her parents, who are initially dismissive but willing to explore the possibility further.",
