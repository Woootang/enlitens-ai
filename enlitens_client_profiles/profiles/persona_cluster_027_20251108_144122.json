  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Sarah grew up in a seemingly stable, middle-class home in suburban St. Louis. However, beneath the surface, her mother struggled with undiagnosed anxiety and a tendency towards over-control. Sarah's father worked long hours and was emotionally distant, leaving Sarah to navigate her own anxieties largely alone. She learned early on to suppress her feelings to avoid upsetting her mother.",
    "adolescence": "Sarah's anxiety intensified during adolescence. The pressure to perform well in school, fit in socially, and navigate the complexities of teenage relationships became overwhelming. She developed perfectionistic tendencies and struggled with social anxiety, often isolating herself from her peers. She briefly saw a therapist for anxiety in 8th grade, but stopped going when she felt better.",
    "early_adulthood": "Sarah excelled academically and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in accounting. She met her husband in college and they married shortly after graduation. She worked full-time as an accountant, but found the demanding work environment and long hours triggering for her anxiety. She switched to part-time work after her son, Owen, was born.",
    "family_structure": "Sarah was raised by both parents in a two-parent household. She has one younger brother who is successful and lives out of state. Her parents are still married, though their relationship has always been somewhat strained by her mother's anxiety.",

Her initial hesitation is understandable given her own experiences and the lingering stigma surrounding mental health. Our goal would be to create a safe and supportive space for both Sarah and Owen to explore their anxieties, develop coping strategies, and build resilience. We'll focus on gentle, evidence-based approaches tailored to their individual needs, empowering them to navigate life's challenges with greater confidence and peace.",
