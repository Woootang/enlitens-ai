  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Growing up, Maya always felt different, but couldn't pinpoint why. Her parents, while loving, often dismissed her sensitivities as 'being dramatic' or 'attention-seeking.' She was a sensitive child, easily overwhelmed by loud noises and social situations. She often retreated into books and imaginative play as a way to cope. There was a subtle pressure to conform and 'be normal,' leading her to mask her true self from a young age. Financial stability was present, but emotional attunement was lacking.",
    "adolescence": "Adolescence brought increased social pressures and a growing awareness of her differences. Navigating friendships and romantic relationships became increasingly difficult. School became a source of anxiety, with sensory overload and social expectations contributing to frequent absences. She began experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety, leading to increasing struggles in school and at home. Family conflicts intensified as she pushed back against expectations and struggled to express her needs.",
    "early_adulthood": "N/A - still in adolescence",
    "family_structure": "Two-parent household, potentially divorced or strained relationship between parents. Siblings may or may not be present, but if they are, there's a sense of comparison and feeling like the 'difficult' child. Possible intergenerational trauma or undiagnosed neurodivergence in family members, leading to a lack of understanding and support.",

    "educational_journey": "Started in public school, but struggled with sensory overload and social anxiety. Frequent absences and academic difficulties led to evaluation and eventual diagnosis. Transitioned to virtual homeschool in hopes of improving academic performance and reducing anxiety. Still struggles with motivation and focus, despite the change in environment.",

    "diagnosis_journey": "Maya suspected something was different about her for years, but her concerns were often dismissed. It wasn't until her academic struggles and increasing anxiety led to a formal evaluation that she received her autism and ADHD diagnoses. The diagnosis process was both validating and overwhelming, providing some answers but also raising new questions about her identity and future. She feels a mix of relief and anger that it took so long to be understood.",
    "how_it_shows_up": "Anxiety manifests as panic attacks, social anxiety, and obsessive thoughts. Autism leads to sensory sensitivities, difficulty with social communication, and intense special interests. ADHD contributes to inattention, impulsivity, and difficulty with executive function. Depression results in low mood, lack of motivation, and feelings of hopelessness. She struggles with masking and code-switching, leading to exhaustion and burnout.",
    "nervous_system_pattern": "Highly sensitive and easily overwhelmed. Prone to hyperarousal and fight-or-flight responses. Difficulty regulating emotions and sensory input. Tends to internalize stress and anxiety, leading to physical symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches.",

    "sensory_profile": "Highly sensitive to sensory input. Overwhelmed by loud noises, bright lights, strong smells, and certain textures. Seeks out calming sensory experiences such as soft blankets, quiet spaces, and gentle movements. Avoids crowded places and situations with high sensory stimulation.",
    "food_sensory_details": "Avoids foods with mixed textures, such as casseroles or stews. Prefers foods that are easily identifiable and separated on the plate. Safe foods include plain pasta with butter, grilled cheese sandwiches (crusts removed, specific brand of cheddar), and crunchy snacks like potato chips (only Lay's classic, nothing flavored) and pretzels (Rold Gold sticks only). Dislikes anything slimy or mushy, such as yogurt or pudding. Only drinks water, and it must be ice cold. Sometimes skips meals altogether when overwhelmed or anxious, leading to nutritional deficiencies. Struggles with trying new foods due to fear of the unknown texture or taste."

Her recent diagnoses of autism and ADHD have shed light on her struggles, but also opened up new avenues for self-discovery. It's clear that years of masking and suppressing her true self have taken a toll, leading to anxiety, depression, and a sense of disconnection. My hope is to create a safe and supportive space where Maya can explore her identity, develop coping strategies, and cultivate a deeper sense of self-compassion. Together, we can work to navigate the challenges she faces and empower her to embrace her unique strengths and abilities.",
