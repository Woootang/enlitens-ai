    "childhood_environment": "Growing up in a working-class family in South City, St. Louis, with a younger sibling who displayed clear signs of neurodivergence early on.

She excelled academically, driven by a desire to create a better future for both of them.",

She worked part-time to help with expenses while juggling her studies and her sibling's needs.
