  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Grew up in a middle-class suburban household. Parents were well-meaning but structured and rigid, emphasizing academic achievement. Home life was relatively stable, but lacked emotional attunement. Her energy and 'quirkiness' was often dismissed as 'just being a kid' or 'daydreaming'.",
    "adolescence": "Excelled academically, masking her ADHD symptoms through hyperfocus and perfectionism. Socially awkward, struggled with maintaining friendships due to impulsivity and difficulty reading social cues. Developed anxiety around performance and fear of failure. Started experiencing periods of intense overwhelm and burnout, often misattributed to just 'stress'.",
    "early_adulthood": "Continued to excel academically, pushing herself relentlessly. The pressure to succeed intensified, leading to increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. Entered a demanding undergraduate program, which further exacerbated her executive functioning challenges. Began to suspect she might have ADHD after a friend mentioned similar struggles.",
    "family_structure": "Two parents, one younger brother. Parents are still married but have a distant, business-like relationship. Brother is neurotypical and successful, often held up as an example. Limited emotional connection with family members.",

    "diagnosis_journey": "Suspected ADHD in late teens/early 20s. Initially dismissed it as 'just stress'. During graduate school, the demands of the program made her symptoms unbearable. Sought formal diagnosis from a psychiatrist who confirmed ADHD-Combined Type. Hesitant to fully embrace the diagnosis due to internalized stigma.",
    "how_it_shows_up": "Difficulty focusing in class and during studying. Procrastination and avoidance of tasks. Impulsivity in spending and communication. Overthinking and racing thoughts.

Safe foods: Plain pasta with butter, specific brand of veggie straws (Sensible Portions), yogurt (only certain brands), and protein shakes. Dislikes mixed textures (e.g., casseroles). Will often skip meals when overwhelmed or stressed. Relies heavily on coffee and energy drinks for focus, leading to energy crashes later in the day. The smell of frying food is particularly offensive to her."
