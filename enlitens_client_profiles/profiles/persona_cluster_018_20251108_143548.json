It's important to validate her experiences, acknowledge her strengths, and help her build a more sustainable and fulfilling life. Focus on practical strategies for managing executive function challenges and reducing sensory overload. Explore mindfulness techniques and self-compassion practices. And help her connect with other parents who understand her struggles.",
