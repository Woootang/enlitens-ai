    "childhood_environment": "Growing up in a seemingly perfect suburban household, Sarah always felt like she was working harder than everyone else to keep up. Her parents were high-achievers, and expected the same from her and her siblings. Emotions were often dismissed as 'drama'.",
    "adolescence": "High school was a constant hustle of AP classes, extracurriculars, and trying to maintain a social life. Sarah developed severe anxiety, which she masked by overachieving. She felt intense pressure to get into a 'good college'. There were also some instances of bullying when she wasn't able to keep up.",
    "early_adulthood": "College brought a temporary sense of freedom, but also intense pressure to choose the 'right' career path. Sarah bounced between majors, feeling lost and overwhelmed. Relationships were fleeting and often ended because she couldn't balance everything. Post-graduation, she threw herself into her career, seeking validation through accomplishments.",

In grad school, she started struggling immensely with focus and organization, despite her best efforts. After talking to a friend who was diagnosed with ADHD, she started researching and realized the symptoms aligned with her experiences. She sought an official diagnosis, which confirmed her suspicions. The diagnosis was both validating and overwhelming.",
