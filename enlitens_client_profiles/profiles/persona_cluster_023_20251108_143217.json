  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Often characterized by underlying anxiety and a feeling of 'not fitting in.' Many experienced a pressure to conform, leading to masking and delayed self-discovery. For some, there may have been a chaotic home environment, possibly due to undiagnosed neurodivergence in family members or financial instability. Others grew up in more structured environments but felt stifled and misunderstood.",
    "adolescence": "Adolescence brought increased social pressure and a growing awareness of being different. This often manifested as anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Academic struggles may have emerged despite underlying intelligence. Some experienced bullying or social rejection. This is where many began to suspect something was different, researching online and self-diagnosing.",
    "early_adulthood": "Early adulthood is marked by a pursuit of higher education or career. The demands of college or early career often exacerbated existing anxieties and executive function challenges. Relationships become more complex, highlighting social difficulties. Late diagnoses (ADHD, Autism) provide some answers but also bring new questions about identity and the past.",
    "family_structure": "Varied family structures, including single-parent households, immigrant families, and families with undiagnosed neurodivergence. Some experienced divorce or loss of a parent.

Safe foods might include plain pasta with butter, grilled chicken (only if it is not dry), and specific brands of crackers (Ritz or Wheat Thins). Some may have difficulty tolerating strong smells or flavors. Binge eating may occur as a coping mechanism for stress or emotional dysregulation. Meal skipping is common when overwhelmed or busy.
