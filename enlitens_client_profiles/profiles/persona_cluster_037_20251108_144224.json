Her parents, both professionals, placed a high value on academics and extracurricular activities. While the home was loving, there was an unspoken pressure to maintain a high level of achievement. Playdates were often structured learning experiences, and free time was frequently filled with enrichment activities.",
    "adolescence": "As Sarah entered high school, the pressure intensified. She thrived academically, earning top grades in her honors classes. She joined the debate team and two dance teams, pouring all her energy into rehearsals and competitions. The workload became overwhelming, leading to chronic stress and difficulty sleeping. She started experiencing anxiety and found it increasingly hard to manage her time and commitments. Socially, she felt like she was constantly performing, trying to maintain a perfect image. Started experiencing feelings of anxiety and self-doubt.",
