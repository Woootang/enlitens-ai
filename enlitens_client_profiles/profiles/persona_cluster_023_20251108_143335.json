  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Growing up, there was a sense of 'otherness' that was never quite explained. High expectations were placed upon academic achievement, often with little understanding of the underlying struggles. There was a lack of open communication about feelings, and emotional expression was often suppressed. Home was stable, but emotionally stifling.",
    "adolescence": "Adolescence was marked by increasing anxiety and social awkwardness. The pressure to conform intensified, leading to masking behaviors and a deep sense of isolation. Academic performance started to slip as executive dysfunction became more pronounced. Friendships were difficult to maintain, and there was a growing sense of being 'different' from peers.",
    "early_adulthood": "Early adulthood brought a mix of independence and overwhelming challenges. College was a time of exploration but also increased stress and burnout. Self-medication with cannabis or other substances emerged as a coping mechanism. Relationships were complicated, marked by intense connections and sudden breakups. The desire for answers grew, leading to the pursuit of a formal diagnosis.",
    "family_structure": "Raised in a nuclear family with immigrant parents or a single-parent household. Siblings may have been present, but the dynamics were often strained due to communication barriers or differing expectations. Grandparents may have played a significant role, adding another layer of cultural influence.",

    "diagnosis_journey": "A lifelong feeling of 'differentness' led to research and self-diagnosis. Initial attempts to seek help were met with skepticism or misdiagnosis. Finally, a formal diagnosis in late teens or early adulthood provided validation and a new understanding of their experiences. The diagnosis process was often emotionally challenging, involving multiple assessments and consultations.",
    "how_it_shows_up": "Anxiety and depression stem from the challenges of navigating a neurotypical world. Difficulty with social interactions, executive dysfunction, and sensory sensitivities lead to overwhelm and burnout. Struggles with emotional regulation and impulsivity. Cannabis or other substances used as a coping mechanism for anxiety and stress.",
    "nervous_system_pattern": "High reactivity to sensory stimuli, leading to frequent overwhelm. Difficulty regulating emotions, resulting in intense mood swings. Tendency to become easily dysregulated in social situations. Chronic stress and anxiety contribute to nervous system fatigue.",

Binge eats when stressed, often consuming large quantities of comfort foods like mac and cheese (Kraft) or cereal (Cheerios). Skips meals when overwhelmed or anxious."
