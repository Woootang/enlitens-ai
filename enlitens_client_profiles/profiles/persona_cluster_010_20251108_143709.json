  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Highly religious, conservative household with strict rules and expectations. Emotional expression was discouraged, and adherence to religious doctrine was paramount. Family prioritized appearances and external validation over genuine connection. Lived in a constant state of anxiety about 'doing the right thing'.",
    "adolescence": "Internal conflict intensified as Jared began questioning his sexuality and religious beliefs. He felt increasingly isolated and alienated from his family and peers. Engaged in secretive online communities for support and information. Started experiencing panic attacks and depressive episodes.",
    "early_adulthood": "Went away to college, initially relieved to escape his restrictive home environment. However, struggled to adapt to the freedom and independence. Overwhelmed by social expectations and academic demands. Started self-medicating with alcohol and food. Experienced a period of intense religious deconstruction and questioning of his identity. Late diagnosis of Autism and ADHD provided some clarity but also increased feelings of being 'different'.",
    "family_structure": "Two parents, one older sister. Father was emotionally distant and critical. Mother was well-meaning but enmeshed and controlling. Sister was the 'golden child' and generally dismissive of Jared's struggles. No significant losses but a profound lack of emotional attunement and support.",

    "pivotal_moments": [
      "Coming out to his parents (met with disapproval and attempts at 'conversion therapy')",
      "Receiving his Autism and ADHD diagnoses (felt both validating and overwhelming)",
      "Moving into his own apartment (a step towards independence but also isolating)",
      "First panic attack (marked a turning point in his mental health)",
      "Discovering affirming LGBTQ+ communities online (provided a sense of belonging and support)"
    ],
    "intergenerational_patterns": "Jared's mother showed signs of undiagnosed neurodivergence (perfectionism, anxiety, sensory sensitivities). His father's side of the family had a history of mental health struggles and substance abuse. The family system perpetuated a pattern of emotional repression and avoidance."

    "diagnosis_journey": "Jared's Autism and ADHD diagnoses came in his early 20s after years of struggling with anxiety, depression, and social difficulties. He initially sought therapy for what he thought was 'just' anxiety. During the course of therapy, the therapist recognized patterns consistent with neurodivergence. He underwent formal testing and received his diagnoses. The Bipolar II diagnosis followed a period of mood instability and hypomanic episodes.",
    "how_it_shows_up": "Autism manifests as sensory sensitivities, social communication difficulties, and intense special interests (coding). ADHD contributes to impulsivity, difficulty focusing, and emotional dysregulation. Bipolar II causes periods of intense mood swings. PTSD is triggered by reminders of past trauma, leading to anxiety, flashbacks, and avoidance behaviors.",

    "sensory_profile": "Highly sensitive to loud noises, bright lights, and strong smells. Prefers soft, comfortable clothing and avoids scratchy fabrics. Enjoys deep pressure and weighted blankets. Finds comfort in repetitive movements and stimming behaviors (hand flapping, rocking).",
    "food_sensory_details": "Avoids foods with mixed textures or strong flavors. Dislikes anything slimy or chewy. Safe foods include plain pasta with butter, grilled chicken (but only if it's not too dry), and specific brands of crackers (Ritz). Only drinks water or specific types of herbal tea (chamomile). Texture is more important than taste; if the texture is off, he can't eat it. Often skips meals when overwhelmed or stressed. Binge eats on crunchy snacks (Doritos, potato chips) when feeling anxious."
