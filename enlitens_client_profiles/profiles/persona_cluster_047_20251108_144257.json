    "diagnosis_journey": "Suspected ADHD in college, but dismissed it due to academic success. Symptoms became more pronounced in his career and marriage.

Relief mixed with regret for lost time and strained relationships.",
    "how_it_shows_up": "RSD leads to intense fear of rejection, impeding friendships and causing him to overthink social interactions. Poor time management results in last-minute rushes, anxiety, and procrastination. Forgetfulness disrupts routines and daily obligations. Experiences intense emotional responses with guilt, shame, and feelings of inadequacy. Becomes defensive and pleads his case until others agree, often going too far. Procrastinates due to fear of failure, hesitant to start new things. All these issues significantly impact his marriage, leading to defensiveness, shutting down, forgetfulness, unmet expectations, and difficulty regulating emotions during conversations.",
