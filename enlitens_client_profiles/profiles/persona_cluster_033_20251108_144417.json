  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Skyler grew up in a lower-middle-class household in South County. Her parents were loving but often overwhelmed. Her dad worked long hours in construction, and her mom worked part-time at Schnucks. There wasn't much emotional attunement; she was a 'good kid' who didn't cause trouble, so her needs were often overlooked.",
    "adolescence": "High school was a confusing time. Skyler struggled to fit in, feeling like she was always slightly 'off.' She excelled academically in subjects she enjoyed (English and history) but struggled with math and science. She had a small group of friends who shared her interests in books and online communities. Social events were exhausting and often led to meltdowns afterward.",
    "early_adulthood": "Skyler went to community college for a while but dropped out due to feeling overwhelmed and unsure of her path. She bounced between various jobs, never quite finding one that felt like a good fit. She experienced several periods of burnout and depression, chalking it up to 'being lazy' or 'not trying hard enough.' She often masked heavily in social and professional situations, leading to exhaustion and anxiety.",
    "family_structure": "Two parents, older brother who was favored for his athletic ability. Parents stayed together, but emotionally distant. Brother moved away after high school and they rarely speak now.",

    "diagnosis_journey": "Skyler's diagnosis journey began with a suggestion from a friend who noticed her social difficulties and sensory sensitivities. Initially, she dismissed the idea, but after researching autism, she realized the descriptions resonated deeply. She sought out a formal diagnosis from a psychologist specializing in autism in adults. The process was validating but also overwhelming, forcing her to re-evaluate her entire life through a new lens.",

Safe foods include: Annie's mac and cheese (specifically the shells variety), plain rice, chicken nuggets (only from McDonald's, prepared fresh), and specific brand of wheat thins. Avoids anything with a slimy texture, like cooked mushrooms or eggplant. Has a strong aversion to the smell of fish. Only drinks water or Diet Coke; texture of juice is off-putting. Will sometimes skip meals entirely if overwhelmed rather than risk eating something 'wrong.'"
