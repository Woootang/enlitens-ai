    "liz_clinical_narrative": "This client presents with a constellation of challenges common in late-diagnosed ADHD. The overwhelm is palpable, stemming from years of masking and struggling without understanding the underlying neurodivergence. Her anxiety exacerbates the executive function challenges, leading to a cycle of procrastination, avoidance, and self-criticism. The long-distance relationship adds another layer of complexity, requiring intentional communication and emotional regulation skills. Therapy will focus on psychoeducation, developing practical coping strategies, and cultivating self-compassion. We will explore her sensory sensitivities and create personalized workarounds to manage overwhelm and build sustainable routines. EMDR may be helpful in processing earlier relational trauma.",
