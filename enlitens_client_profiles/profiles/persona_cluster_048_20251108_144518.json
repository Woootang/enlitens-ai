We can create a therapeutic environment where she feels seen, heard, and understood, and help her develop coping strategies to manage her sensory sensitivities and emotional distress. The squishmallows are a starting point for building trust and connection, and we can explore other sensory-based interventions to promote regulation and well-being.
