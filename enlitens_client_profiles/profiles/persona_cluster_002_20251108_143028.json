  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Grew up in a stable, middle-class household with involved parents. Was generally a 'good kid' who followed the rules and excelled academically, leading to ADHD symptoms being overlooked. Always felt like she had to work harder than others to achieve the same results. Family valued achievement and followed the rules.",
    "adolescence": "High school was a mix of academic success and internal struggle. Started experiencing anxiety and self-doubt, especially when comparing herself to peers. Maintained good grades but often procrastinated and relied on last-minute cramming. Socially awkward and struggled with feeling like she fit in. Started to develop some perfectionist tendencies.",
    "early_adulthood": "College was a turning point. The unstructured environment and increased demands led to feeling overwhelmed and burnt out.

Grad school, if applicable, exacerbated these issues.",

Diagnosis was validating but also brought up feelings of grief and anger about the missed opportunities and struggles of the past.",
