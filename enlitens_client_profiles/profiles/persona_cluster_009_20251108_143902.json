They've achieved external success, but at a great personal cost. Now, the weight of their experiences, coupled with the demands of their current life, has become unbearable. We'll work collaboratively to unpack the layers of masking, identify their unmet needs, and develop strategies for self-compassion and authenticity. I want to help them find a way to live a life that honors their true self, not the person they think they should be. It's time to rewrite the narrative from one of striving and depletion, to one of acceptance, growth, and genuine well-being.",
