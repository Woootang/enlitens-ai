It's clear that she's carrying a significant burden and has been invalidated by medical professionals in the past. Her self-awareness and desire to understand herself, particularly the possibility of DID, is a testament to her resilience. Our work together would focus on creating a safe and validating space for her to process her trauma, explore her identity, and develop coping mechanisms for managing her sensory sensitivities and emotional dysregulation. We'd also work collaboratively to identify and address the barriers that are preventing her from accessing the support and care she needs and deserves. My priority would be to empower her to reclaim her sense of self and create a life that feels more manageable and fulfilling.",
