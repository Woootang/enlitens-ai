    "childhood_environment": "Grew up in a middle-class, suburban home. Her parents were loving but had high expectations.

The home was generally stable, but achievement was highly valued, and mistakes were not often discussed.",
    "adolescence": "High school was a constant pressure cooker. She excelled academically but felt immense pressure to maintain her GPA and participate in extracurriculars. She was a cheerleader and involved in student government. Developed early anxiety around college applications and 'measuring up'. Social life was based around performance and achievement rather than genuine connection.",
    "early_adulthood": "College was a blur of late nights studying and trying to maintain a perfect image. She joined a sorority, further exacerbating her need to 'fit in' and perform. She felt immense pressure to secure a prestigious internship and then a high-paying job after graduation. Started experiencing panic attacks during her senior year, which she hid from everyone.",

Will only eat fruit if it's perfectly ripe and not bruised. Cannot tolerate chunky soups or stews. Often skips meals when overwhelmed or stressed.

Addressing their perfectionistic tendencies and helping them develop self-compassion will be crucial. Therapy should focus on building coping skills for managing anxiety, improving self-esteem, and fostering a sense of self-acceptance. Exploring the root causes of their anxiety and addressing any underlying trauma will also be important.",
