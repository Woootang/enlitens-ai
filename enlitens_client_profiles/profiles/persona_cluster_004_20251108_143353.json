Developed perfectionistic tendencies and a strong need for control. Started experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety, such as stomach aches and headaches.",

    ],
    "intergenerational_patterns": "Her mother also struggled with anxiety and perfectionism, passing down these tendencies to her daughter.
