  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Growing up, there was a sense of not quite fitting in, even if they couldn't articulate why. Rules and expectations felt arbitrary and confusing. Perhaps a chaotic home environment, moving frequently, or subtle emotional neglect.",
    "adolescence": "Adolescence was a minefield of social expectations and awkwardness. They likely experimented with different identities, trying to find a place where they belonged. There might have been bullying, social isolation, or intense hyperfixations on niche interests to cope. First experiences with substances could have begun here, self-medicating for anxiety or sensory overwhelm.",
    "early_adulthood": "Early adulthood brought the crushing weight of expectations \u2013 career, relationships, independence. The masking they learned in childhood became exhausting, leading to burnout and a sense of being lost. Self-diagnosis with autism likely occurred during this period, sparked by online research and relatable experiences shared by others.",
    "family_structure": "Could be a nuclear family, single-parent household, or something in between. Dynamics might have been strained, with parents who didn't understand their sensitivities or need for routine. Siblings may have been allies or sources of further misunderstanding.",

    "diagnosis_journey": "The journey often starts with a growing sense of 'differentness' throughout their life. Online research and community connection lead to self-diagnosis. Seeking formal diagnosis is fraught with challenges \u2013 long waitlists, expensive assessments, and the potential for invalidation by professionals unfamiliar with adult autism. The experience with Bipolar, PTSD, and Anxiety can predate the autism recognition, leading to ineffective treatment before the full picture is understood.",

Tends to skip meals when overwhelmed or hyperfocused."
