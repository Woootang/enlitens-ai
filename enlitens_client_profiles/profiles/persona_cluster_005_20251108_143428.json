  "developmental_story": {
    "childhood_environment": "Growing up, there was a sense of being 'different' without understanding why. Always struggled to keep up, felt overwhelmed in group settings, and was often labeled as 'sensitive' or 'difficult'. Routines were either rigidly enforced or completely absent, creating a constant state of anxiety and unpredictability. School was a minefield of social expectations and academic pressures.",
    "adolescence": "Teenage years were marked by increasing anxiety and social isolation. Struggled to fit in, experienced bullying or exclusion, and developed a strong sense of self-doubt. Academic performance fluctuated wildly, with periods of intense focus followed by complete burnout. Started experimenting with coping mechanisms like compulsive eating or withdrawing from social situations.",
    "early_adulthood": "Early adulthood brought a mix of freedom and overwhelming responsibility. Moving away from home (or wanting to) highlighted the challenges of independent living. Navigating college or the workforce proved difficult, leading to feelings of burnout and inadequacy. The increasing pressure to 'adult' led to seeking answers and a late diagnosis of Autism and/or ADHD.",
    "family_structure": "Likely raised in a nuclear family, but dynamics may have been strained by a lack of understanding or acceptance of neurodivergent traits. One or both parents may have struggled with their own mental health or undiagnosed neurodivergence. Sibling relationships may have been complicated by feelings of comparison or competition.",

    "educational_journey": "Started strong but struggled as expectations increased. Difficulty focusing in class, managing workload, and navigating social dynamics. May have experienced frequent school changes or disruptions. Periods of academic success were often followed by burnout and withdrawal.",
    "pivotal_moments": [
      "Realizing they were different from their peers",
      "Experiencing a major social rejection or bullying incident",
      "Receiving a late diagnosis of Autism and/or ADHD",
      "Experiencing a period of intense burnout or mental health crisis",
      "Finding a supportive community or therapist who understands"
    ],
    "intergenerational_patterns": "Likely that neurodivergent traits have been present in the family for generations, but never properly identified or addressed. Family members may have struggled with similar challenges, such as anxiety, depression, or social isolation. There may be a history of substance abuse or other maladaptive coping mechanisms."

    "diagnosis_journey": "The diagnosis journey likely started with a growing sense of unease and a feeling of being 'different'.

Seeking a formal diagnosis was a process of finding the right professional, navigating insurance, and facing the emotional impact of finally having an explanation for their struggles.",

Safe foods include plain Cheerios (specifically the yellow box), a specific brand of Townhouse crackers (original only), grilled chicken (only if it's room temperature and not too dry), and overcooked pasta with butter. Only drinks water from a specific reusable bottle. Dislikes mixed textures like casseroles or sauces with chunks. Skips meals when overwhelmed or anxious. Binge eats sugary snacks when stressed as a form of self-soothing. Finds it difficult to try new foods."
