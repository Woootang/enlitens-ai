For years, I worked with doctors and tried various treatments to manage stress, anxiety, and depression\u2014seeing small but unsustainable progress. Looking back, I can now see that the burnout was decades in the making. Understanding my ADHD has helped me view my past decisions with more compassion. I'm raising two daughters, navigating a demanding career, and managing an emotionally immature partner\u2014all while trying to break old patterns and avoid losing myself again. I've realized how much of my life has been spent masking and reshaping myself to fit into environments that weren't right for me. Now, I feel isolated, overwhelmed, and unsure how to build a healthier, more authentic life while grieving what could have been. The ADHD insight was pivotal, but I know there are still deeper layers I need help unpacking so I can show up fully for my daughters\u2014and for myself."

Over the last year he saw a psychologist every Saturday for Play Therapy until June when she switched practices. We are looking for a therapist to continue with Jude.

I am a counseling masters student, and over the past year or two have been considering the possibility of an Autism/ADHD diagnosis. I don\u2019t fully resonate with the diagnoses individually, but I have resonated with the new discourse around AuDHD and the sort of internal conflict it causes that looks different than the individual diagnoses. I am interested in discussing the pros and cons of pursuing a diagnosis, and also my main concern which is executive dysfunction.",

        "Hi, my daughter Alice is looking for a therapist to help her with coping with emotional outbursts and her transition to middle school, we have to figure out some motivation techniques. She has ADHD and is queer. You are not in my network (Anthem) but she actually found you and picked you out, so I wanted to know about your sliding scale. Thanks",
        "Hello, I actually called your office and left a message but wanted to send an email and didn\u2019t know for sure what your email was. My daughter, Lindsey, is needing some help. She is struggling with her executive function. She is actually struggling with some life stuff too. She is failing college. She\u2019s also not sure what she wants to do with her life (career). I think she\u2019s lost. She\u2019s only had this diagnosis for a few years. She has so many great qualities. She\u2019s just getting lost with all the things she\u2019s struggling with. She has depression and it seems to be getting a little worse recently. And she also struggles with her weight from binge eating. I did read your information on your website and it look like you possibly might be able to help her get her life in order and help her figure out how her brain works and utilize her strengths. I just hate seeing her like this. I appreciate your time and consideration. Lesley.",
        "Hello, I am inquiring for my ten-year-old daughter. She has started saying negative things about her body. I try to stress just making healthy choices, but I don't think it's sinking in. She has even mentioned that she is worried she will develop an eating disorder later on in life. I want to try to nip this in the bud as soon as possible and tackle it before it gets worse. What are your fees and what insurance do you take? I wish our healthcare system prioritized mental health; it is so important! The best days/times we are available are Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays any time after 3. The best way to reach out to us is probably either by phone or text. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you!",
        "Charlotte is 10 years old in 5th grade. She has been diagnosed autistic with ADHD inattentive and auditory processing disorder. She's had many issues accessing education and coping with sensory input. What I see in her right now is more negative feelings, and I want to help her life experience be better. She is looking for ways to avoid school this year which signals to me that she needs more help.",
        "Christina Warden highly recommended you for help with my daughters (7 and 5). I have left an emotionally abusive 20-year-long relationship with their father and am now in a healthy, committed queer partnership. It is a very amicable situation, but I also want to give the girls the support they need during this big transition. I have long suspected they are both neurodivergent, as my ex and I are both ND. The oldest has recently has some violent outbursts, and I want to get her the help she needs before it escalates any further. Email is the best way to reach me, although we can also speak via phone. Looking forward to talking with you!"
