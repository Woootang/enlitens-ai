You are a neuroscience research analyst extracting comprehensive scientific content.

DOCUMENT TEXT:
{text_excerpt}

Extract ALL research content from this document. Be thorough and liberal in extraction - include both explicit statements and reasonable inferences. Even if information seems limited, extract what you can and infer related content.

Generate content for ALL fields below:

1. FINDINGS: List 5-15 key research findings, discoveries, or conclusions. Include main results, secondary findings, interesting observations, and supporting evidence. Be comprehensive!

2. STATISTICS: List 5-15 statistical data points, numbers, percentages, effect sizes, sample sizes, p-values, confidence intervals, or quantitative results. Include any numerical data mentioned.

3. METHODOLOGIES: List 5-15 research methods, study designs, experimental procedures, data collection methods, analysis techniques, participant selection methods, or measurement approaches used.

4. LIMITATIONS: List 3-10 study limitations, weaknesses, potential confounds, sample restrictions, methodological concerns, or areas needing further research. If not stated, infer reasonable limitations.

5. FUTURE_DIRECTIONS: List 3-10 suggestions for future research, unanswered questions, areas needing investigation, or next steps mentioned or implied by the research.

6. IMPLICATIONS: List 5-15 clinical implications, practical applications, therapeutic relevance, real-world applications, or how this research informs practice. Be creative in inferring applications!

7. CITATIONS: List 5-15 key papers cited, author names mentioned, referenced studies, or important sources. Extract any citation information present.

8. REFERENCES: List 5-15 bibliographic details, reference list entries, or source materials. Extract any reference information present.

IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract liberally - related content counts!
- If explicit information is missing, infer reasonable content from what IS present
- Break down complex findings into multiple list items
- Each list should have AT LEAST 3 items, preferably 5-15
- Use clear, complete sentences
- No numbering or bullet points in strings
- Better to over-extract than under-extract!

Return as JSON with these EXACT field names:
{{"findings": [list], "statistics": [list], "methodologies": [list], "limitations": [list], "future_directions": [list], "implications": [list], "citations": [list], "references": [list]}}
