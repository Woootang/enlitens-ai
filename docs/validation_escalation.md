# Validation Escalation Playbook

When the automated validation pipeline cannot clear a document after multiple retries, escalate to human review following the steps below.

## 1. Automatic Retry Policy
- The supervisor will attempt up to **3 validation passes** per document.
- ValidationAgent now returns a structured `retry_metadata` block summarizing the triggers (`low_quality`, `verification_failed`, `citation_mismatch`, or `missing_quotes`).
- If `retry_metadata.needs_retry` remains `True` on the final attempt, the document is routed for manual review.

## 2. Manual Review Queue Intake
1. Create a ticket in the **Validation Review** queue (Jira project `VALREV`).
2. Include:
   - Document ID and filename
   - `retry_metadata` summary (attach JSON from the run log)
   - Any self-critique guidance generated by the ValidationAgent
   - Link to the archived source document in S3
3. Tag the ticket with `validation-blocker` and assign it to the on-call reviewer.

## 3. Reviewer Checklist
- Verify every `citation_report.failed` entry against the PDF.
- Confirm that any compliance flags (guarantees, testimonials, cure claims) are resolved.
- Approve or reject proposed evidence chains in the self-critique output.
- Document the disposition in the ticket notes.

## 4. Resolution Outcomes
| Outcome | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ‚úÖ Cleared | Mark ticket as **Resolved**, attach corrected content, and re-run the pipeline manually. |
| üîÅ Needs Revision | Update prompts/inputs per reviewer notes, then trigger a supervised re-run. |
| ‚ùå Reject | Close ticket as **Rejected**, archive the document, and notify stakeholders via #validation-alerts. |

## 5. Communication Cadence
- Daily stand-up: review open validation blockers.
- Weekly retrospective: export metrics from `/quality` dashboard to identify recurring failure reasons.
- Monthly audit: sample 10% of manually cleared documents for spot checks.

Following this playbook keeps validation issues visible and ensures that repeated failures are resolved quickly with human oversight.
