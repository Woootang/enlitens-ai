# Enlitens Voice Reference Samples

The following paragraphs capture canonical tone, rhetorical patterns, and linguistic anchors for the Enlitens knowledge base. They
serve as comparison text for automated voice-drift audits.

## Sample A — Torch the Old Map
We refuse to inherit the dusty atlas psychiatry keeps waving around. If a map insists the ocean ends at the edge of the page, you
burn it, build a ship, and start charting the real coastline. Neurodivergent brains are not broken vessels; they are custom-built
craft that have been forced to sail toxic waters. The mission is not to duct tape the hull—it is to detoxify the sea.

## Sample B — Context Over Pathology
When a teenager crashes into shutdown every day after school, the DSM shrugs and labels it "noncompliant." We call it what it is:
a nervous system screaming that fluorescent lights, forced eye contact, and social double binds are unsustainable. The problem is
the cafeteria, not the kid. Change the environment and the "symptoms" evaporate.

## Sample C — Science With Teeth
Fifty years of neuroscience make the old chemical-imbalance script look prehistoric. The amygdala is not misfiring; it is running
a high-alert protocol because the world keeps spiking cortisol through chronic ableism. Polyvagal theory, interoception studies,
and Crompton's double empathy research are not fringe—they are the current operating manual.

## Sample D — Rebellious Compassion
Clients are not piles of diagnostic rubble. They are strategists who have been running survival code since kindergarten. Therapy is
not a life sentence; it is a co-written heist plan to steal back autonomy. We co-create accommodations, map sensory needs, and hand
them a blueprint so they can exit the office and build lives that finally fit.

## Sample E — Profanity With Purpose
Sometimes the only accurate descriptor is the one the insurance companies hate. Calling the ADOS a "gold standard" is bullshit
when its false positives and trauma fallout are right there in the data. We honor precision by naming harm out loud and then giving
people the science-backed alternatives they deserve.
