## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install NVIDIA drivers (if not already installed)
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables for optimal performance
export OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1
export OLLAMA_MAX_QUEUE=1
export OLLAMA_RUNNERS_DIR=/tmp/ollama-runners
export TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA=1
```

### 2. Ollama Setup
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Pull the required model (in another terminal)
ollama pull qwen3:32b
```

### 3. Verify GPU Setup
```bash
# Check GPU status
nvidia-smi

# Check CUDA version
nvcc --version

# Test PyTorch GPU support
python3 -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Option 1: Stable Execution (Recommended)
```bash
# Run with stable execution script (prevents SSH tunnel issues)
./stable_run.sh

# Monitor progress
python3 monitor_processing.py --continuous --interval 30
```

### Option 2: Direct Execution
```bash
# Run the multi-agent processor directly
python3 process_multi_agent_corpus.py \
    --input-dir enlitens_corpus/input_pdfs \
    --output-file enlitens_knowledge_base_final.json \
    --st-louis-report st_louis_health_report.pdf
```

### Option 3: Test First
```bash
# Test the system with a single document
python3 test_multi_agent_system.py
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor processing in real-time
python3 monitor_processing.py --continuous

# Check system resources
nvidia-smi

# Monitor specific log files
tail -f logs/multi_agent_processing_*.log

# Check Ollama status
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### Progress Tracking
- üìÅ **Output files**: `enlitens_knowledge_base_*.json`
- üìù **Log files**: `logs/multi_agent_processing_*.log`
- üíæ **Temp files**: `enlitens_knowledge_base_*.json.temp` (auto-cleaned)
- üñ•Ô∏è **System status**: `python3 monitor_processing.py`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### SSH Tunnel Issues
If you see thousands of SSH tunnel errors:
```bash
# Kill stuck processes
pkill -f "ssh_tunnel"
pkill -f "process_.*corpus"

# Clear terminal state
stty sane

# Run with stable script
./stable_run.sh
```

### GPU Memory Issues
```bash
# Check GPU memory
nvidia-smi

# Clear GPU memory
python3 -c "import torch; torch.cuda.empty_cache()"

# Restart Ollama with memory limits
pkill ollama
ollama serve
```

### Common Issues
1. **Ollama not responding**: Restart with `ollama serve`
2. **GPU out of memory**: Process fewer documents or restart system
3. **JSON parsing errors**: Check log files for specific error messages
4. **Slow processing**: Monitor GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi`
