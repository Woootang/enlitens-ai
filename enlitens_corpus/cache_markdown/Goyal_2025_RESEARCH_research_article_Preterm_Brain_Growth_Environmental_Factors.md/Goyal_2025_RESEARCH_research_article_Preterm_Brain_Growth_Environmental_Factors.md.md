DOCUMENT SUMMARY This 2025 retrospective study provides direct biological evidence for 
the Enlitens principle that lived experience shapes the brain. It found that the degree of 
prematurity and exposure to prenatal steroids result in significantly different linear brain growth 
patterns, particularly in white matter tracts like the corpus callosum, even in the absence of 
major brain injury. This research offers a powerful, neurobiological basis for understanding that 
brain differences are often logical outcomes of an individual's unique developmental history.

Differential linear brain growth patterns in preterm neonates based on birth
gestational age and steroid exposure: A retrospective chart review

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This highly technical medical paper provides powerful, biological evidence for our core belief 
that "every brain makes perfect sense for the life it's lived." It moves the conversation from 
abstract theory to concrete data, showing how significant early life experiences—specifically the
degree of prematurity and exposure to prenatal medical interventions—physically alter the 
brain's structural development. This supports our neurodiversity-affirming and trauma-informed 
stance by providing a scientific basis for understanding that neurological differences are not 
arbitrary "defects" but are often logical, predictable outcomes of an individual's unique 
developmental history. For any client with a history of premature birth, this research is a 
profound validation of their different neurotype.

Critical Findings: How Early Life Experience Shapes the Brain

This retrospective study analyzed cranial ultrasounds of 326 preterm infants to measure how 
different perinatal factors affected brain growth by the time they reached term-equivalent age 
(36-40 weeks GA).

● Degree of Prematurity Matters: Extreme preterm (EP) infants (born 22-28 weeks GA) 
had significantly smaller dimensions in key brain areas compared to very preterm (VP) 
infants (born 28-32 weeks GA), even when neither group had major parenchymal brain 
injury. Specifically, the EP group had:
○ Smaller biparietal diameter.
○ Shorter corpus-callosum length.
○ Smaller corpus-callosum-fastigial distance.

○ Smaller cerebellar-vermis height.

● Prenatal Steroid Exposure Has an Impact: While cumulative postnatal steroid use 
showed no significant association with the brain metrics measured, exposure to 
antenatal (prenatal) steroids did.

○ Exposure to antenatal steroids was negatively associated with corpus callosum 
length and the depth of the pons, even after adjusting for other clinical risk 
factors.

○ However, biparietal diameter and deep gray matter structures (basal ganglia, 

caudate nucleus) were preserved despite antenatal steroid exposure.

● Other Environmental Factors: The study also found that other early life factors 

influenced brain structure:

○ Fetal Growth Restriction: Infants who were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) 

had a significantly smaller biparietal diameter and basal ganglia width compared 
to non-SGA infants.

○ Biological Sex: Female neonates had a significantly smaller biparietal diameter 
than male neonates in the full cohort. In the most premature group (EP infants), 
females also had a significantly smaller trans-cerebellar diameter than males.

The "No Normal Brain" Evidence

This study is a perfect biological case study for neurodiversity. It shows that there is no single, 
standard trajectory for brain development. Instead, the brain's physical structure at term is 
significantly influenced by a variety of factors unique to the individual's perinatal experience, 
including:

● How early they were born (gestational age).
● Medical interventions they were exposed to in the womb (antenatal steroids).
● Their in-utero growth conditions (SGA status).
● Their biological sex.

These findings demonstrate at a neurological level that brains develop differently in response to 
different environmental conditions and inputs, a core tenet of the Enlitens philosophy.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the main finding: "Preterm infants born ≤28 weeks GA have significantly 
smaller dimensions of major white matter tracts than preterm infants born 
28–32 weeks GA at term equivalence".

● On the impact of prenatal steroids: "Exposure to antenatal steroids negatively impacts

corpus-callosum length and pons anteroposterior depth".

● On the lack of postnatal steroid effect: "This study found no significant association 
between cumulative doses of postnatal corticosteroids and linear brain metrics of 
preterm infants born <32 weeks GA".

● On the many factors influencing brain development: "Potential clinical factors 
contributing to altered brain development include environmental stressors [10], 
ventilation strategies or corticosteroid exposure [11], suboptimal nutrition [12], 
intermittent hypoxia [13], and infection/inflammation [14]".

Clinical Implications (The Enlitens Way)

While this is a neonatal medical study, its implications for our work with older children, teens, 
and adults are profound. For any client with a known history of premature birth, this research 
provides tangible validation for their lifelong experience of being different. It allows us to ground 
our conversations in neurobiological fact: their brain did not "go wrong," but rather it developed 
logically and adaptively in response to the extraordinary circumstances of its early environment. 
This knowledge can be a powerful tool for reframing identity, fostering self-acceptance, and 
shifting the focus from "what is wrong with me?" to "what happened to me, and how has that 
shaped the unique way my brain works?".
