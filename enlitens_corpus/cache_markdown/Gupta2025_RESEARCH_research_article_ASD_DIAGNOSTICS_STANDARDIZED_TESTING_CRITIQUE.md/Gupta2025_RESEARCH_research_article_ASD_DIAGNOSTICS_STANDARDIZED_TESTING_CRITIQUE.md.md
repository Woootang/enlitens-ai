DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This 2025 research article from CNS Spectrums critically examines the significant challenges in 
diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), directly supporting Enlitens' core mission. It 
provides extensive evidence against the reliability of "gold standard" tests like the ADOS-2, 
detailing high false-positive rates, gender and racial biases, and reduced accuracy in real-world 
clinical settings. The paper strongly advocates for moving beyond a simplistic reliance on 
standardized testing towards a more nuanced, clinically-informed approach that prioritizes 
developmental history, cultural context, and the assessment of co-occurring conditions, 
validating the Enlitens clinical interview model.

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is foundational evidence for our work. It systematically dismantles the myth of a "gold
standard" diagnostic tool for autism and validates our emphasis on clinical interviews, 
developmental history, and culturally-responsive assessment. The authors highlight the exact 
populations we serve—females, high-IQ/high-masking individuals, and ethnic minorities—as 
being at the highest risk for misdiagnosis due to biased and flawed testing instruments. The 
article provides a wealth of statistics and clinical arguments we can use in our whitepaper, 
marketing materials, and advocacy to challenge the broken conventional assessment system. It 
proves that our approach is not just an alternative, but a necessary evolution in mental 
healthcare.

Critical Statistics for Our Work

Prevalence & Systemic Burden

● Rising Prevalence: The estimated prevalence of ASD among eight-year-old children in 

the U.S. rose from 1 in 44 in 2022 to 1 in 36 in 2023.

● Clinical vs. Community Prevalence: The prevalence of ASD in clinical samples is 

reported to be 5 times higher than in the general community.

● Inpatient Prevalence: One study revealed that 1 in 10 adults admitted to inpatient 
psychiatric facilities had a history of suicidal attempts with possible underlying ASD 
symptoms.

● Wait Times: 61% of organizations reported wait times for psychiatric evaluations 

exceeding 4 months, with 15% experiencing delays of over a year.

● Therapy Gaps: An estimated 37% of individuals with ASD do not receive any therapy, 

and 30% do not receive any treatment at all.

● Rural vs. Urban Divide: Rural areas show significantly lower rates of ASD evaluations 
recorded by the age of 36 months compared to urban areas. Utah, Tennessee, and 
Missouri have the lowest percentage of evaluations recorded by age three.

Flaws in Standardized Screening & Testing

● M-CHAT (Screening Tool):

○ Recent studies report its sensitivity is only 33.1% to 38.8%.
○ Its positive predictive value (PPV) is only 14.6% to 17.8%.
○ The M-CHAT has a notably poor PPV among ethnic minorities.

● ADOS-2 (The "Gold Standard"):

○ False Positives: A study on a clinical sample of children and adolescents 
without ASD reported a 34% false-positive rate when the ADOS-2 was 
administered. Those with false positives often exhibited high anxiety and low 
Restricted and Repetitive Behavior (RRB) symptoms.

○ Specificity Issues: While sensitivity is high (0.94), overall specificity is modest 

(0.80), leading to a higher likelihood of false positives. In clinical settings, 
specificity tends to be variable.

○ Decreasing Accuracy: The accuracy of ADOS-2 modules decreases as the 

module number increases (i.e., with age and verbal fluency), with Modules 3 and 
4 showing lower overall accuracy. One study found an overall accuracy across all
modules of just 70.4%.

○ Poor Performance with Comorbidity: In a psychiatric inpatient unit for ages 9-
18, ADOS-2 Modules 3 and 4 showed lower sensitivity (58.3% and 55.6%) and 
specificity (56.5% and 59.5%). Higher "E-scores" (emotional/behavioral issues 
like ADHD symptoms, anxiety) are associated with lower sensitivity and 
specificity.

○ Interrater Reliability: Even as a semi-structured test, the interrater reliability for 

ADOS-2 for diagnostic classification ranges between only 64%-82%.

Critique of Standardized Testing & The Diagnostic 
System

Foundational Bias in Diagnostic Tools

Many screening and diagnostic tools, including the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-
CHAT), Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS), and Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI), 
were primarily developed and validated using samples composed mainly of white males. This 
creates a significant challenge, as these measures may lack the sensitivity to detect ASD in 
females and individuals from different cultural backgrounds.

"This disparity arises in part because many screening and diagnostic tools were 
primarily validated on white male samples, leading to cultural and gender biases."

The Failure of the "Gold Standard" (ADOS-2)

Although considered the standard for diagnosis in controlled research settings, the ADOS-2 has
documented limitations. Its performance in real-world clinical samples may be lower than data 
from research settings suggests.

● False Positives & Comorbidity: ADOS-2 may not be as effective as a gold standard in 

clinical samples characterized by a higher prevalence of comorbidity. The study 
recommended
 against using ADOS-2 in isolation for diagnosis and suggested incorporating structured 
parental interviews, which show better specificity.

● Context Matters: The optimal use of ADOS-2 is validated for outpatient-based clinical 

settings, and it performs sub-optimally in other contexts like inpatient settings.

● Over-reliance on Testing: Clinicians commonly exhibit reluctance to heavily rely on 

clinical judgment, a tendency often linked to an overemphasis on testing. This hesitancy 
is often amplified by policies from managed care or schools that are not supported by 
empirical evidence.

Diagnostic Overshadowing

A wide range of comorbid conditions can overshadow the core symptoms of ASD, leading to 
misdiagnosis or missed diagnoses.

● ADHD: Remains a more frequent diagnosis among ASD youth, and until DSM-5 (2015), 

they were mutually exclusive, leading to an overemphasis on ADHD.

● Anxiety & OCD: In late school-age children, social anxiety disorder frequently 

overshadows ASD due to lagging social skills, and OCD can be misdiagnosed when 
restrictive interests are misinterpreted as compulsions.

● Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): Self-harm in adolescents with ASD is 

frequently misunderstood and overshadowed by BPD. It's not uncommon for autistic 
individuals to carry a BPD diagnosis into adulthood.

● Psychotic Disorders: Individuals with ASD may show 'pseudopsychotic' symptoms, 

leading to misdiagnosis. The rate of psychotic disorders in adults with ASD is at least 10 
times higher than in the general population.

● Eating Disorders: Restrictive eating behaviors should be carefully evaluated as a 

potential indicator of ASD, particularly in adults with minimal observable impairments.

Support for Clinical Interviews & Nuanced Assessment

The paper repeatedly emphasizes the need for a "paradigm shift" away from insufficient tools 
and toward comprehensive clinical assessment.

The Primacy of Clinical Judgment

● ASD continues to be primarily diagnosed through clinical assessment, using tools to

 aid clinicians, not replace them.

● Hesitancy to diagnose ASD clinically contributes to gaps in care.
● A structured interview and a comprehensive assessment of comorbidities can be 

valuable tools to support a clinical diagnosis of ASD, especially when suspicion is high 
and testing yields false negatives.

● A thorough chronological assessment of symptom ontology is essential for accurate 

diagnostics. This includes a detailed developmental history, inquiries about pregnancy 
complications, and early life challenges.

Specific Interview Questions & Areas of Inquiry (For the Enlitens Interview)

The paper provides excellent, specific examples of what to ask and look for, validating our 
interview-based approach.

Table: Effective Strategies for Clinical Practice

● Critical Question: Is male preponderance attributed to ADOS-2?
● Clinical Significance: Screening tools like MCHAT, ADOS, and ADI have been 

developed and validated primarily in males.

● Critical Question: How do ASD individuals with higher IQs differ clinically?
● Clinical Significance: High-functioning individuals, particularly females, may test 

negative and consequently remain undiagnosed.

● Critical Question: Why may ADOS-2 yield false negatives?
● Clinical Significance: High-functioning individuals are particularly susceptible to false 

negatives when assessed using ADOS-2.

How to Ask Narrow Questions (Adapted from Figure 2)

● Social/Communication:

○ Ask about poor eye contact, lack of response to name, joint attention, pretend 

play, and making friends.

○ For older individuals, ask about their ability to perceive social nuances like body 

language, tone, and sarcasm.

○ Address the inability to maintain intimate relationships, potential learned 

helplessness, and a diminished desire to socialize.

● Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors:

○ Ask about strong, particular interests (video games, Legos, trains, dinosaurs).
○ Inquire about strict adherence to routines and becoming upset by minor changes 
(bathing time, new clothes, school route alterations, cancellations). They may 
strongly prefer consistency and sameness.

● Sensory Perception:

○ Ask about refusal or insistence on eating specific foods.
○ Inquire about meltdowns in noisy environments.
○ Ask about resistance to haircuts, prolonged showers, and aversions to tight 

clothing or physical touch (e.g., cutting tags off shirts).

Populations Discussed

● Females: At heightened risk of underdiagnosis. They may exhibit a tendency to 

compensate for deficits, utilize compensatory strategies to mask social deficits, and 
employ camouflaging. Females on the spectrum often display more eye contact.

● High-Functioning / High IQ Individuals: Are a distinct phenotype likely to be missed. 
They may effectively acquire social skills, mitigating challenges, but this compensation 
often comes at the cost of heightened anxiety. Routine screenings may not capture the 
complexity of their presentation.

● Ethnic Minorities: At heightened risk of underdiagnosis. Diagnostic tools validated on 
white male samples lead to cultural biases. The MCHAT has a poor PPV among ethnic 
minorities, and employing multilingual staff may enhance screening accuracy.

● Cultural Variations: Cultural norms can be mistaken for symptoms or mask them. For 
instance, in Japan, children are encouraged not to maintain direct eye contact with 
adults as a sign of respect, which can complicate diagnosis in high-functioning 
individuals.
