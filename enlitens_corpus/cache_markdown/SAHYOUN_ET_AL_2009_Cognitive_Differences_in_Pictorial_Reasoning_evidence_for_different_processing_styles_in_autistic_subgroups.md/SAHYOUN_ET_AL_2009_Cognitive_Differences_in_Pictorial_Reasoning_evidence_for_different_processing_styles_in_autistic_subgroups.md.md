DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This research article investigates cognitive differences in pictorial reasoning between individuals
with High-Functioning Autism (HFA), Asperger's Syndrome (ASP), and a neurotypical control 
group. The study used a novel assessment task designed to differentiate between linguistic and 
visuospatial processing strategies. The findings are highly relevant to Enlitens' mission as they 
provide experimental evidence that different neurotypes employ distinct cognitive strategies to 
solve the same problems, even when arriving at correct answers. This supports the Enlitens 
argument that standardized tests measuring only accuracy (the "what") are insufficient and that 
a clinical approach is needed to understand the processing style (the "how"), which is critical for 
providing appropriate support and understanding individual strengths.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "The three groups did not differ in accuracy, but showed different response time 

profiles."

● "HFA participants appeared to favor visuospatial over linguistic mediation."
● "The results support the use of linguistic vs. visuospatial tasks for characterizing 

subtypes on the autism spectrum."

● "...pictures may be processed and manipulated 'as a referent' (i.e. visually) or as a 

representation of a referent (i.e. semantically)."

● "Macintosh and Dissanayake (2004) warn against the potential circularity in 

interpretation when selecting dependent variables that are co-dependent on diagnostic 
criteria. For instance, group differences on tasks that measure language ability should 
not be surprising when the groups are formed based on language development criteria."

● "Happé and Frith (2006) have emphasized the superiority of open-ended tasks in 

investigating processing biases in autism."

● "The relationship between visuospatial and linguistic abilities may therefore be a more 
powerful metric for differentiating between high-functioning autism and Asperger 
syndrome than an absolute measure of language abilities alone."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Accuracy: The study found no significant main effects or interactions for accuracy 

across the HFA, ASP, and control groups, meaning all groups were similarly accurate on
the tasks.

● Response Times (RT): A significant Group x Condition interaction was found for 

response times.

○ ASP & Control Groups: Both groups were fastest on the hybrid 

Visuospatial+Semantic (V+S) condition, suggesting they benefited from having 
both processing routes available.

○ HFA Group: This group was equally fast on the Visuospatial (V) and the hybrid 
(V+S) conditions, and slowest on the Semantic (S) condition. This suggests they 
favored a visuospatial strategy whenever one was available.

● Correlation with IQ (in the open-ended V+S condition):

○ HFA Group: Performance (accuracy) was significantly correlated with nonverbal 

IQ (NVIQ) but not with verbal IQ (VIQ). This indicates a preference for 
visuospatial processing strategies.

○ ASP Group: Performance was significantly correlated with verbal IQ (VIQ) and a
language-independent reasoning test (RPM), but not with nonverbal IQ (NVIQ). 
This suggests the use of verbal mediation and general reasoning skills.

○ Control Group: Performance showed no significant correlation with either verbal

or nonverbal IQ, suggesting no strong bias towards either strategy.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

Differentiating Autistic Subgroups for Research

The study's methodology for distinguishing between High-Functioning Autism (HFA) and 
Asperger's Syndrome (ASP) highlights the reliance on developmental history, which is a key 
component of a clinical interview process.

● "Individuals on the autism spectrum were identified on the basis of the ADI-R (Lord, 

Rutter & Le Couteur, 1994) and ADOS-G (Lord et al., 2000), and met DSM-IV criteria for
autism or Asperger syndrome."

● "Specifically, while both these groups scored above the ADI cut-off for autism, 

participants with Asperger syndrome were without significant history of early language 
delay (e.g. absence of oneword at 24 months or two-word phrases at 36 months), 
echolalia, pronoun reversal, or stereotypical language (no occurrence of out-of-context 
repetitive sentences)."

● "In contrast, individuals with HFA manifested delayed and/or atypical spoken language 

development based on the above criteria."

Designing an Assessment to Reveal Cognitive Strategies

The study created a novel pictorial reasoning task specifically designed to reveal underlying 
cognitive processing differences, rather than just measuring ability. This serves as a model for 
developing assessments that go beyond simple accuracy scores.

● The task involved three conditions designed to be equally difficult but to engage different

cognitive processes:

○ SEMANTIC (S): Required accessing conceptual meanings of pictures to find 

associative relationships (biasing toward linguistic strategy).

○ VISUOSPATIAL (V): Used meaningless geometric forms, requiring visuospatial 

manipulation and making linguistic mediation difficult.

○ VISUOSPATIAL+SEMANTIC (V+S): A critical "hybrid" condition that used 

meaningful pictures (like the S condition) but required visuospatial manipulation 
(like the V condition). This open-ended condition allowed for either strategy, 
making it possible to observe processing preferences.

● Task difficulty was carefully controlled across conditions by matching them on relational 

complexity, including the reasoning type, number of transformations/relationships, and 
number of dimensions manipulated.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Dichotomy of Linguistic vs. Visuospatial Processing in Autism

The paper is framed around the theory that individuals on the autism spectrum vary in their 
reliance on linguistic versus perceptual abilities, and that this difference can be used to 
understand subtypes.

● "To the extent that individuals on the autism spectrum have been found to vary in their 
linguistic vs. perceptual abilities (Behrmann, Thomas, & Humphreys, 2006; Tager-
Flusberg & Joseph, 2003), we proposed to investigate visual perception and conceptual 
processing in high-functioning autism (HFA) vs. Asperger syndrome (ASP)."

● "Individuals with autism typically appear to have difficulties taking advantage of semantic

context cues and with language pragmatics, though semantic comprehension is 
relatively spared."

● "The implication of this study was that semantic information processing per se may not 
be impaired, but rather some of the language deficits observed in participants with 
autism could be modality-dependent, with a visual advantage in autism spectrum 
disorders (ASD)."

● "It appears then that some individuals with autism may rely on visual rather than verbal 

codes and favor visuospatial strategies in reasoning (Koshino et al., 2005)."

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

High-Functioning Autism (HFA)

The HFA group demonstrated a clear preference for visuospatial reasoning strategies, 
performing efficiently when such strategies were available, and less efficiently when linguistic 
processing was required.

● The HFA group was significantly slower on the SEMANTIC condition compared to the 

VISUOSPATIAL and VISUOSPATIAL+SEMANTIC conditions.

● "This suggests that linguistic processing may be less efficient than visuospatial 

processing of pictorial stimuli in HFA."

● In the hybrid V+S condition, the HFA group's accuracy was significantly correlated with 

their nonverbal IQ but not their verbal IQ.

● "This clearly points to a strategy preference for visuospatial processing in HFA..."
● "The authors argued that individuals with autism were unable to spontaneously generate

strategies based on verbal mediation when these could help task performance."

Asperger's Syndrome (ASP)

The ASP group's performance profile was much more similar to the neurotypical control group, 
showing flexibility in using both linguistic and non-linguistic reasoning.

● The ASP group, like the control group, was fastest on the hybrid V+S condition, 

suggesting they benefited from the availability of both processing routes.
● In the hybrid V+S condition, the ASP group's accuracy was correlated with
 both verbal IQ and a language-independent fluid reasoning test (RPM).

● "The ASP group thus showed a significant relationship between their performance in the 
V+S condition and their verbal skills as well as more general, language-independent fluid
reasoning ability."

● "Asperger syndrome individuals may recruit both verbal mediation and fluid reasoning 

resources."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

The study demonstrates a practical method for differentiating autistic subtypes based on 
cognitive processing style rather than just behavior or developmental history. This supports a 
move away from monolithic diagnostic labels toward a more nuanced, dimensional 
understanding.

● "The protocol developed in this study may be a powerful paradigm for differentiating 

cognitive profiles characteristic of autistic phenotypes."

● "The relationship between visuospatial and linguistic abilities may therefore be a more 
powerful metric for differentiating between high-functioning autism and Asperger 
syndrome than an absolute measure of language abilities alone."

● "The dichotomy between visuospatial and linguistic profiles along the autism spectrum 

provides opportunities for using functional brain imaging to elucidate the neurobiological 
correlates of the different patterns of cognitive efficiency found in this study, along with 
structural imaging to help differentiate between possible phenotypes of the disorder."
