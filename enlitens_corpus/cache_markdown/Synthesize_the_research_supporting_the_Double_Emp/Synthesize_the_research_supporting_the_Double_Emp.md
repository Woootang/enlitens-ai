The Double Empathy Problem: Research Synthesis on Autistic and Non-Autistic
Social Interaction

1. Introduction

The "Double Empathy Problem" (DEP) is a paradigm-shifting framework in autism research that challenges

traditional, deficit-based models of autistic social communication. Rather than viewing communication difficulties

as a one-sided impairment in autistic individuals, the DEP posits that misunderstandings and breakdowns in social

interaction are bidirectional—arising from a mismatch in communication styles, expectations, and interpretations

between autistic and non-autistic (neurotypical) people (Lai, 2025; Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al., 2025; Freeth &

Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Bolis & Schilbach, 2017). This model is supported by

empirical evidence showing that both groups experience greater ease and enjoyment when interacting with others

of the same neurotype, and that communication barriers are often mutual rather than solely located within autistic

individuals (Lai, 2025; Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al., 2025; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton &

Petty, 2023; Bolis & Schilbach, 2017). The DEP has significant implications for clinical practice, education, and

social inclusion, advocating for a more nuanced, neurodiversity-affirming approach to understanding and

supporting autistic people.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy targeted foundational theories, empirical studies, measurement critiques,

intervention research, and interdisciplinary perspectives on the Double Empathy Problem and autistic-neurotypical

social interaction. In total, 949 papers were identified, 557 were screened, 221 were deemed eligible, and the top
20 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1 Core Evidence for the Double Empathy Problem

Empirical studies and reviews consistently support the DEP, showing that communication difficulties between

autistic and non-autistic people are reciprocal and context-dependent (Lai, 2025; Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al.,

2025; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Bolis & Schilbach, 2017). Both groups

report higher satisfaction and understanding when interacting with others of the same neurotype, and mismatches

in communication style, nonverbal cues, and social expectations contribute to mutual misunderstanding (Lai, 2025;

Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al., 2025; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Bolis &

Schilbach, 2017). For example, autistic individuals may rely less on facial expressions and more on direct

communication, while neurotypicals may misinterpret these differences as a lack of empathy or social interest (Lai,

2025; Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al., 2025; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton & Petty, 2023;

Bolis & Schilbach, 2017).

3.2 Critique of Traditional Deficit Models

Traditional models, such as Theory of Mind (ToM) deficit and social motivation hypotheses, have been critiqued for

pathologizing autistic communication and failing to account for the bidirectional nature of social interaction (Lai,

2025; Haas, 2022; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Bolis & Schilbach, 2017). The DEP reframes these difficulties as a

product of mismatched social norms and expectations rather than inherent deficits, emphasizing the need to
consider both autistic and non-autistic perspectives (Lai, 2025; Haas, 2022; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Bolis &

Schilbach, 2017).

3.3 Measurement and Methodological Considerations

Reviews of empathy and social cognition measures highlight that many tools lack measurement invariance and

may not accurately capture the lived experiences or strengths of autistic individuals (Harrison et al., 2020;

Harmsen, 2019; Bird et al., 2013; Blair, 2005; Orm et al., 2021). This can lead to mischaracterization and
stigmatization, reinforcing the importance of developing more inclusive, neurodiversity-informed assessment tools

(Harrison et al., 2020; Harmsen, 2019; Bird et al., 2013; Blair, 2005; Orm et al., 2021).

3.4 Implications for Practice and Inclusion

The DEP has informed new approaches in clinical, educational, and workplace settings, advocating for mutual

understanding, accommodation, and the validation of autistic communication styles (Haas, 2022; De Marchena
et al., 2025; Morris et al., 2025; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Han et al., 2021). Interventions that focus on bridging

communication gaps, rather than "fixing" autistic people, are increasingly recognized as more effective and

respectful (Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al., 2025; Morris et al., 2025; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Han et al., 2021).

4. Discussion

The Double Empathy Problem is now widely recognized as a robust, evidence-based framework for understanding

the social challenges experienced by autistic and non-autistic people in interaction (Lai, 2025; Haas, 2022; De

Marchena et al., 2025; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Bolis & Schilbach, 2017). It

moves beyond deficit-based models by highlighting the reciprocal nature of misunderstanding and the

importance of context, communication style, and mutual adaptation (Lai, 2025; Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al.,

2025; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Bolis & Schilbach, 2017). This perspective
is supported by studies showing that both groups communicate more effectively and enjoyably with those who

share their neurotype, and that mismatches in social norms and expectations are a primary source of difficulty (Lai,

2025; Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al., 2025; Freeth & Morgan, 2023; Orm et al., 2021; Hamilton & Petty, 2023;

Bolis & Schilbach, 2017).

Measurement critiques further underscore the need for more inclusive, context-sensitive tools that reflect the

diversity of autistic experience (Harrison et al., 2020; Harmsen, 2019; Bird et al., 2013; Blair, 2005; Orm et al., 2021).

The DEP also has practical implications, informing interventions that prioritize mutual understanding,

accommodation, and the validation of autistic communication (Haas, 2022; De Marchena et al., 2025; Morris et

al., 2025; Hamilton & Petty, 2023; Han et al., 2021). However, more research is needed to explore the DEP in
diverse populations, real-world settings, and across the lifespan.

5. Conclusion

The Double Empathy Problem is a well-supported, paradigm-shifting framework that reframes autistic and non-

autistic social interaction as a mutual, context-dependent challenge rather than a one-sided deficit. This approach

is transforming research, practice, and policy by emphasizing neurodiversity, mutual understanding, and the need

for more inclusive communication strategies.

5.1 Research Gaps

Key gaps include the need for more research in minimally verbal populations, non-Western contexts, and

longitudinal studies of DEP-informed interventions.

Question

Why

How does the Double Empathy Problem manifest in minimally
verbal or non-speaking autistic individuals?

Understanding this will ensure inclusivity
and inform tailored interventions.

What are the most effective ways to bridge communication gaps
in mixed neurotype groups in real-world settings?

This will improve social, educational, and
workplace outcomes.

How can measurement tools be improved to better capture the
lived experience of autistic people in social interaction?

Valid, inclusive tools are essential for
research and practice.
