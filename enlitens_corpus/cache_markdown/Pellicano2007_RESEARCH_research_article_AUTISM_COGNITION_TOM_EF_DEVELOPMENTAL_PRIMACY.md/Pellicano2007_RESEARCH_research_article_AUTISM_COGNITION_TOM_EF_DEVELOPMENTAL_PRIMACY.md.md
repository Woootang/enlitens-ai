DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This 2007 study provides a critical, evidence-based model for understanding the developmental 
relationship between executive function (EF) and theory of mind (ToM) in young autistic 
children. The research finds a clear, one-way developmental primacy: intact executive function 
appears to be a necessary prerequisite for developing a theory of mind. This shifts the focus 
from a simple "deficit" model to a more nuanced developmental understanding, directly 
supporting the Enlitens mission to understand how different brains work and pointing toward 
more effective, non-pathologizing support strategies.

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is foundational because it moves beyond simply listing "deficits" in autism and 
instead provides a scientific model for how cognitive development unfolds differently. The 
central finding—that executive function skills are a likely prerequisite for Theory of Mind—offers 
a logical, non-pathologizing explanation for why some autistic individuals struggle with social 
intuition. This allows us to reframe the conversation with clients from "you have a ToM deficit" to
"let's explore the foundational executive skills that support social understanding." It provides a 
clear target for strengths-based support (bolstering EF) and validates our approach of looking at
the whole, developing person rather than a static diagnostic label.

The Central Finding: A One-Way Developmental Pathway

The study examined the pattern of impairments in Theory of Mind (ToM) and Executive Function
(EF) in a group of 30 young autistic children, using a conservative definition of impairment 
(scoring >1 standard deviation below the typically developing mean). The results were striking 
and showed a clear one-way relationship.

● The Dissociation: The domains were dissociable in only one direction: impaired ToM 

with intact EF.

● The Numbers: 27% of autistic children showed impaired ToM alongside intact EF.

● The Null Result: Conversely, zero children in the study showed the reverse pattern of 

intact ToM with impaired EF.

● Conclusion: This pattern of findings supports the view that EF may be an important 

factor in the advancement of ToM understanding in autism. It suggests that rudimentary 
EF skills are a crucial building block for the later development of ToM.

into each category of impairment. Note the empty cell for "Intact ToM / Impaired EF," which is

Implications for Strengths-Based Support

This developmental model provides a clear pathway for intervention that is not focused on 
"fixing" a deficit but on building foundational skills.

● Target the Foundation: Instead of trying to teach abstract social rules, a more effective 
approach may be to directly support the underlying executive function skills, such as 
planning, cognitive flexibility (set-shifting), and inhibition.

● Social Interaction as a Mediator: Poor executive control can negatively impact a child's
ability to regulate their behavior during social interactions, which in turn limits the quality 
and quantity of those learning opportunities. Supporting EF could therefore improve 
social interactions, which then helps develop mental-state awareness.

The Critical Role of Language

The study also found that verbal ability is a key, independent factor in developing Theory of 
Mind.

● Children with autism who displayed

 no impairments in either ToM or EF had significantly higher verbal IQ scores than 
children who had one or two impairments.

● Regression analysis showed that both EF and verbal IQ made

 unique, independent contributions to the variance in ToM scores.

● This suggests that having strong language skills is another crucial building block for 

developing an understanding of other minds in autism.

Performance vs. Competence: The "Passers"

A significant portion of the autistic children performed well on the laboratory tasks, but this 
doesn't necessarily equate to real-world social competence.

● One-Third Passed: One-third of the children in the autism group passed the ToM and 

EF tasks at a level consistent with their age and ability.

● "Hacking Out" Solutions: The study acknowledges the theory that these "passers," 

often armed with strong language and executive skills, may be able to "hack out" logical 
solutions to the experimental tasks without having a true, intuitive social understanding.

● The Real-World Question: This highlights a critical question for future research: 

whether the skills demonstrated in a lab setting by some young autistic children actually 
translate into competence in real-life, everyday social interactions. This directly supports 
the Enlitens focus on lived experience over test scores.
