DOCUMENT SUMMARY This 2013 study provides powerful evidence for a neurodivergent 
strength, finding that autistic adolescents

outperformed their typically developing peers on a complex decision-making and gambling 
task. This superior performance was driven by a logical, loss-avoidant strategy that resisted the 
temptation of risky, high-reward options that fooled their neurotypical peers. The study also 
debunked the myth of the "unfeeling" autistic person, showing both groups had equal 
physiological and emotional arousal during the task.

Enhanced Decision Making and Risk Avoidance in High-Functioning 
Autism Spectrum Disorder

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is a flagship example of a neurodivergent strength and provides powerful scientific 
evidence for our core mission. It directly contradicts the deficit-based model by demonstrating 
that an autistic thinking style leads to superior outcomes in a complex, affective decision-
making task. The study shows that the autistic participants' "loss-avoidance style" is a more 
logical and successful strategy than the neurotypical participants' impulsive "reward-seeking 
style."

This is a perfect illustration of how a trait often pathologized as "rigidity" or "risk-aversion" is 
actually a highly adaptive and logical strength in certain contexts. Furthermore, the study 
debunks the stereotype of the unfeeling autistic person by showing that the physiological 
markers of emotional arousal were intact and equal to those of the control group. We can use 
this study to show clients and their families that what the world calls a disorder is often a 
different, and in some cases better, way of thinking.

Critical Findings: Evidence of Neurodivergent Strengths

Contrary to their own hypotheses, the researchers found that the autistic group demonstrated 
enhanced performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a measure of affective decision-
making.

● Superior Performance: Autistic (ASD) participants were "superior to control participants
on overall performance" , and demonstrated "significantly superior performance". This 
enhanced performance was driven by "improved learning over the latter part of the task".

● A Logical, Loss-Avoidant Strategy: The superior performance was the result of a 

different decision-making style.

○ The IGT includes a "trap" deck (Deck B) which offers frequent large rewards but 

occasional, catastrophic losses.

○ The typically developing (CON) group was drawn to this deck, demonstrating a 

"reward-seeking decision making style" and a focus on immediate gain.

○ The ASD group chose from the risky Deck B

 significantly less often than the control group. Their decision-making is 
described as a
 "loss-avoidance style".

○ The authors conclude: "it may be that the occasional large loss associated with 
the B deck was sufficient for the ASD group to attenuate the level of preference 
for that deck seen in the typical controls".

● Intact Emotional/Physiological Arousal: The study hypothesized that the autistic 
group would show diminished physiological arousal (skin conductance response), 
indicating they weren't using "affective cues." This hypothesis was proven false.

○ There were

 no group differences in skin conductance response (SCR).

○ The ASD group was "equally physiologically responsive as controls both in 

anticipation of deck choice and in response to loss trials".

○ This adds to evidence that "children and adolescents with ASD experience 

simple affective cues similarly to their typical peers". The difference is not in the 
feeling, but in the interpretation and resulting action.

Pathologizing a Strength

Even after finding a clear area of superior performance, the authors immediately reframe this 
strength as a potential real-world deficit. This is a classic example of the system's inability to 
accept neurodivergent strengths at face value.

● The authors speculate: "in many everyday situations, including social situations, risk-

avoidance likely leads to anxious, social avoidance rather than any potential benefits of 
prosocial engagement".

● They also suggest this risk-avoidance "may also underpin aspects of restrictive, 

repetitive behaviors and interests".

● Enlitens Reframe: The problem is not the logical, loss-avoidant thinking style. The 

problem is a social world that is unpredictable, frequently unrewarding, and not designed
for autistic people, making avoidance a logical and adaptive response.

Quotes We Might Use

● On superior performance: "Instead we found that young people with ASD make more 
advantageous choices than controls during the IGT and demonstrate significantly 
superior performance".

● On the reason for success: "...the ASD group was more successful at this task 

because they more frequently avoided the temptation to choose from the 'big-gain' deck,

possibly because of an aversion to the low frequency 'big-loss' associated with this 
deck".

● On the different thinking styles: "...the difference in IGT performance in this study can 
again be explained by a reward-seeking decision making style in typical adolescents and
a loss-avoidance style in the ASD group".

● On intact emotional response: "The SCR data with no group differences suggests that
the ASD group is equally physiologically responsive as controls both in anticipation of 
deck choice and in response to loss trials".

● On the immediate pathologizing of a strength: "Nonetheless in many everyday 
situations, including social situations, risk-avoidance likely leads to anxious, social 
avoidance rather than any potential benefits of prosocial engagement".
