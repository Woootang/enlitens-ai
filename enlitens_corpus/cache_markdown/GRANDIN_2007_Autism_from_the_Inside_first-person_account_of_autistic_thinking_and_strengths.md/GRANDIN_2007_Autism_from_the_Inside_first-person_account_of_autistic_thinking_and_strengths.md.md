DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This article by Dr. Temple Grandin, a prominent autistic professor, provides a powerful first-
person account of autistic thinking styles and advocates for a strengths-based approach to 
education. She explains that autistic cognition is not a deficient version of neurotypical thinking 
but a different mode of processing, such as thinking in pictures, patterns, or verbal facts. This 
document is essential for Enlitens as it offers direct, lived-experience evidence for the 
neurodiversity paradigm, reframes "symptoms" like fixations as motivational strengths, and 
provides concrete examples of how standard educational practices and assessments can fail to 
accommodate and recognize autistic intelligence.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Teachers need to understand how autistic people think. How I think is different from 

how 'normal' people think."

● "I have had teachers ask me, 'How can I get the pictures out of the student's head?' The 

answer is that you cannot. Pictures are the autistic student's way of thinking."

● "The bottom line is that skills are uneven, and encouraging students to excel in their 

strongest areas is better than trying to push for well-roundedness."

● "The secret to motivating a student with autism is to broaden the student's fixations into 

useful activities."

● "Fixations are great motivators, and it is often a mistake to stamp one out. Try to help the

student develop his or her fixation into a useful skill that other people will value."

● "An autistic student often does better by 'selling' his or her work, rather than by relying 

on a charismatic personality."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS: MODELS 
OF AUTISTIC THINKING (FIRST-PERSON 
ACCOUNT)

Dr. Grandin describes three distinct cognitive styles she has observed in the autistic population, 
providing a model for neurodiversity in thought processes.

1. Photorealistic Visual Thinkers (like herself)

● "As I described in Thinking in Pictures (1995), all my thoughts happen in photorealistic 

pictures."

● "My mind works like the search engine Google when it does an image search. If 

somebody says the word saddle, the first image I see in my imagination is an English 
saddle, my most prized possession when I was in high school. The next image is the 
tack room full of saddles at my aunt's guest ranch in Arizona. The third image is tennis 
courts. How did I get from a saddle to tennis courts? Next to my aunt's tack room were 
tennis courts for the ranch guests. My thinking is associative and is often not sequential 
or linear."

● "Research using brain scans now shows that my brain works differently in its greater 

reliance on its visual areas."

2. Pattern Thinkers

● "Some [people with autism] think in visual or sound patterns instead of in pictures."
● "These pattern thinkers 'see' in their mind's eye relationships between numbers instead 

of photorealistic images, they usually excel in music and math."

3. Verbal/Factual Thinkers

● "Still other people with autism appear to have almost no ability in visual imagery."
● "They think with long lists of words and facts and often love history and sports statistics."

CRITIQUE OF CURRENT EDUCATIONAL &
ASSESSMENT PRACTICES

Grandin's advice to teachers serves as an implicit critique of standardized methods that fail to 
account for autistic cognitive and sensory differences.

Critique of Processing Speed & Verbal Instruction

● Give the student time to respond. "I process information slowly, and I need time to 
provide an answer. I remember a very frustrating episode from kindergarten. The 
assignment was to mark all the pictures of things that began with B. I failed to mark a 
picture of a bike and a birdbath. The teacher did not give me time to explain that I did not
know the difference between the little trike that I rode and a bike. I also marked the bird-
bath picture G for garden."

● Avoid long strings of verbal directions. "When I ask for directions when I am driving, I

have to write them down if anyone tells me more than three steps. I have absolutely no 
sequential memory for verbal directions. If the student can read, provide him or her with 
written instructions."

Critique of Ignoring Sensory Needs

● Respect sensory sensitivities. "The way an autistic child perceives the world is 

different, many have heightened sensitivities. Sensory sensitivities can vary, but in class 
the teacher may need to help a student cope. When my elementary school bell rang, it 
hurt my ears as much as a dentist drill does when it hits a nerve. I have great difficulty 
hearing another person talk if there is too much background noise."

Critique of the Goal of "Well-Roundedness"

● "The bottom line is that skills are uneven, and encouraging students to excel in their 

strongest areas is better than trying to push for well-roundedness. If a 7th grader can do 
12th grade math, he or she should be taking 12th grade math. Otherwise the student will
become bored and have behavior problems."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS (A 
STRENGTHS-BASED MODEL)

Develop the Student's Strengths

● "The most successful adults with autism, Asperger's syndrome, dyslexia, or other 

learning problems had teachers who developed their strengths."

● "I use my ability to think visually in my business designing livestock facilities."

Use Special Interests ("Fixations") as a Gateway to Learning

● "The secret to motivating a student with autism is to broaden the student's fixations into 

useful activities."

● "If a child likes airplanes, then use airplanes as the subject for reading and math. 

Fixations are great motivators, and it is often a mistake to stamp one out. Try to help the 
student develop his or her fixation into a useful skill that other people will value."
● Personal Example: "In my case, nobody was interested in my obsessive interest in 
cattle squeeze chutes... When I eventually transformed the obsession into the skill of 
designing cattle chutes and other facilities, other people became interested in what I 
could do."

The Importance of Mentorship and Apprenticeship

● "My high school science teacher, Bill Carlock, saved me. By giving me interesting 

projects, he gave me a reason to study: to become a scientist."

● "Some of the most successful individuals on the autism spectrum were 'apprenticed' into 

such fields as auto mechanics or computer programming."

● "An autistic student often does better by 'selling' his or her work, rather than by relying 
on a charismatic personality. Showing student work in a portfolio is a good strategy. 
Talent will attract a mentor."

Developing Social Skills Through Shared Interests

● "Socially, high school was the worst time in my life. I was teased constantly. My only 
refuges from teasing were horseback riding and my science teacher's electronics lab 
because the kids who sought these activities were not the kids who teased."

● "I recommend getting children with autism or Asperger's syndrome into activities where 
they can socialize through shared interests with other children. Specialized activities or 
clubs, such as robotics, chess, spelling bees, art, music, or computer programming, are 
wonderful for students on the autism spectrum."
