DOCUMENT SUMMARY This review article examines the profound challenges and 
transformative potential within child and adolescent forensic evaluations, driven by scientific and
technological advancements. The authors critique systemic issues like evaluator bias and poor 
report quality, then explore the complex implications of teleassessment, artificial intelligence 
(AI), and, most critically, epigenetics. The paper advocates for an epigenetic framework that 
reframes behaviors often labeled "maladaptive" as context-specific, evolutionarily programmed 
adaptations to adverse environments, urging a shift away from a purely pathological model.

Child and Adolescent Forensic 
Evaluations: Challenges Amid Scientific 
and Technological Advancements

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is a cornerstone document for the Enlitens mission because it explicitly advocates 
for the paradigm shift we are championing, particularly within the high-stakes field of forensic 
assessment. The authors’ discussion of epigenetics provides a robust, scientific framework for 
our core belief: that behaviors often labeled "maladaptive" or "disordered" are logical, context-
specific adaptations to a person's environment. The call to move away from pathologizing labels
and toward understanding behaviors as "evolutionarily 'ordered' and preprogrammed changes" 
in response to adversity is a direct validation of our philosophy.

Furthermore, the paper’s extensive critique of systemic bias (adversarial, racial, and cognitive) 
and the documented poor quality and inconsistency of standardized forensic reports provides 
powerful, citable evidence for our whitepaper. It strengthens our argument against the flawed 
model of traditional testing and for the necessity of a more nuanced, scientifically grounded, and
humane approach like the Enlitens Interview.

Critical Statistics for Our Work

● Poor Quality of Forensic Reports:

○ Evidence of poor-quality competency to stand trial reports is "replete in the 

literature".

○ Despite this, psychological recommendations are followed by judges in 

approximately 75% of cases.

○ A recent study found that less than 20% of forensic reports explained how a 
mental disorder actually influenced a client's competence-related abilities.

○ An analysis of reports for the American Board of Forensic Psychology found that 
opinions were rendered without sufficient explanation over 50% of the time.

● Prevalence and Impact of Bias:

○ Judges commonly cite expert bias as a problem in forensic reports.
○ Approximately one-third of surveyed magistrates identify bias as a "considerable 

issue" with forensic reports.

○ In cases of criminal insanity, one study found that forensic evaluators agreed on 

criminal responsibility only 53% of the time.

○ Psychologists conducting custody evaluations faced allegations of bias in 49% of

cases.

● Failures of Standardized Risk Assessment Tools:

○ In one study, clinical judgments of risk made by professionals using two common
tools (the SAVRY and J-SOAP-II) were "no more accurate than chance" in 
predicting recidivism.

○ A systematic review of various risk assessment tools for adolescents concluded 

that their predictive validities were "insufficient in the precise estimation of 
recidivism".

● Racial Bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI):

○ An AI algorithm used for predicting criminal reoffending was found to be racially 

biased against Black defendants, who were more likely than White defendants to 
be incorrectly classified as high risk.

Methodology We Can Learn From

● The Daubert Standard: The article frames the discussion around the Daubert standard, 
which provides five criteria for the scientific validity of expert testimony: (a) testability, (b)
peer review and publication, (c) known or potential error rate, (d) existence of controlling 
standards, and (e) widespread acceptance in the scientific community. This provides a 
legal and ethical framework for critiquing existing assessment tools and developing our 
own.

● Bias Mitigation Strategies: The paper discusses the "bias blind spot," where evaluators
tend to see themselves as less biased than their peers. It suggests a "hybrid model" for 
interviewing where the evaluator begins without case-specific information to reduce 
confirmation bias, then reviews details later to guide more targeted questions.

● Life Course Health Development (LCHD) Model: The authors recommend using the 
LCHD model, which emphasizes social and structural determinants of health, as a 
critical framework to guide interpretation of forensic evaluations.

Findings That Challenge the System

● Behavior as Adaptation (The Epigenetic View): The paper's most powerful challenge 
to the system is its reframing of behavior through an epigenetic lens. It argues that in 

response to adverse environments like high-crime neighborhoods, "antisocial behaviors 
(aggression, callousness, impulsivity, recklessness, etc.) may serve an adaptive role". 
This perspective encourages "the shift from labeling certain behaviors as 'maladaptive' 
and categorizing personalities as 'disordered,' to understanding these personalities and 
behaviors as edited according to the context in which they emerge".

● Pervasive and Unacknowledged Bias: The article systematically dismantles the myth 
of the objective expert. It details multiple sources of bias, including adversarial allegiance
(siding with the hiring attorney), self-selection bias (experts taking cases that align with 
their beliefs), and the "bias blind spot".

● Systemic Failure of Standardized Tools: The paper provides a damning review of 
several widely-used risk assessment instruments for juveniles, citing multiple studies 
that show they have poor psychometric properties and insufficient predictive accuracy. 
This provides direct evidence for the claim that the tools themselves are often flawed.
● AI Inherits Human Bias: The article warns that AI is not a neutral solution to human 

bias. It cites clear evidence of machine learning algorithms perpetuating and amplifying 
racial bias present in the justice system.

Populations Discussed

● The primary focus is on children and adolescents undergoing forensic evaluations for 
matters such as delinquency, child protection, custody disputes, and competency 
hearings.

● The paper stresses the increasing need for cultural competence due to the "significant 

cultural diversity among individuals involved in the legal system".

Alternative Approaches Mentioned

● The Epigenetic Framework: This is presented as a transformative alternative for 
conceptualizing cases. It focuses on how environmental factors cause biological 
changes that affect gene expression, leading to behaviors that are adaptive within a 
specific context.

● Structured Decision-Making Models: To combat poor report quality and bias, the 

authors advocate for the use of structured approaches, principles, and checklists over 
unstructured clinical judgment. They highlight a 10-point decision-making model for 
juvenile presentence evaluations.

● Life Course Health Development (LCHD) Model: This model is recommended for its 
focus on social and structural determinants of health, providing a broader and more 
holistic framework for understanding an individual's development and behavior.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the Adaptive Nature of Behavior: "In forensic practice, a juveniles' behaviors are 

often assessed and described as maladaptive, but when epigenetics are considered, 
what is adaptive or maladaptive becomes context-specific".

● On Shifting Away From Pathology Labels: The epigenetic framework "encourages the
shift from labeling certain behaviors as 'maladaptive' and categorizing personalities as 
'disordered,' to understanding these personalities and behaviors as edited according to 
the context in which they emerge".

● On the "Why" Behind Adaptation: A youth's brain may "genetically reprogram itself to 
change the course of its neurodevelopment to foster behavioral strategies that promote 
functionality and success consistent with environmental demands". This reprogramming 
is "evolutionarily 'ordered' and preprogrammed... in response to an unfavorable 
environment".

● On the Bias Blind Spot: "...forensic evaluators tend to view themselves as less biased 

than their colleagues".

● On Flawed Assessment Tools: "...clinical judgments of risk made by professionals 
using the SAVRY and J-SOAP-II were 'no more accurate than chance' (p. 520) in the 
prediction of recidivism...".

Clinical Implications

● Adopt an Epigenetic Lens: Forensic professionals must understand the principles of 

epigenetics to accurately interpret findings and make recommendations, recognizing that
behaviors are influenced by the interplay between genes and adverse environments.

● Re-evaluate "Maladaptive" Behaviors: Behaviors deemed "antisocial" must be 

considered for their potential adaptive function within a youth's specific, often harsh, 
environment. This understanding should lead to "the least restrictive remediation and 
additional considerations in court".

● Acknowledge and Mitigate Bias: Evaluators must be aware of their cognitive and 

social biases and actively use strategies to correct for them, such as structured decision-
making models.

● Be Cautious with New Technology: While teleassessment and AI offer potential 
benefits, practitioners must proceed with caution, adhering to ethical guidelines, 
demanding scientific validation (per the Daubert standard), and being vigilant about 
inherent biases, especially when working with minors.
