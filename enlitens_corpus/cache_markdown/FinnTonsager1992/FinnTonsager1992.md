Therapeutic Effects  of Providing MMPI-2 Test  Feedback
to College Students Awaiting Therapy

Stephen E. Finn and  Mary E. Tonsager
University of Texas at Austin

This study  investigated the  benefits  of sharing Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2
(MMPI-2) test results verbally with clients. Ss were randomly selected  from  a college counseling
center's  waiting list: 32 received test  feedback according  to a collaborative model  developed by
Finn  (1990) and  29  received  only examiner attention.  Groups  did  not  differ  on  age,  sex, days
between examiner contact, and initial levels of distress and self-esteem. Compared  with the con-
trols, clients who completed the MMPI-2 and heard their test results reported a significant decline
in symptomatic distress and a significant increase in self-esteem, and felt more hopeful about their
problems, both immediately following the feedback session and at a 2-week follow-up. Also, clients'
subjective impressions of the feedback session  were overwhelmingly positive. Although the study
failed  to identify  specific client variables or elements of the feedback session that were related  to
these changes,  the findings indicate that psychological  assessment can  be used as a therapeutic
intervention.

Providing  test  feedback to  clients  was once  generally dis-
couraged as a potentially harmful  practice  (e.g., Klopfer, 1954;
Klopfer & Kelley, 1946—both quoted  in Tallent, 1988, pp.  47-
48). Recently, however, many respected  clinicians have urged
assessors to discuss test results with clients or give them a writ-
ten report of test findings (e.g., Berg, 1984,1985; Butcher, 1990;
Finn,  1990; Fischer,  1972, 1979,  1986; Williams, 1986).  This
change  in attitude  is partly due  to  the  recognition  of  clients'
legal rights to access  professional records (Brodsky, 1972) and
to the inclusion of test feedback in lists of ethical behaviors of
psychologists  (American  Psychological  Association  [APA],
1990; Pope, 1992). In addition, it is believed that sharing psycho-
logical  test  results  with clients builds  rapport  between  client
and  therapist, increases client cooperation  throughout the as-
sessment process, and leaves clients with positive feelings about
psychological testing and  mental  health professionals in gen-
eral (e.g., Dorr, 1981; Finn & Butcher, 1991; Fischer, 1986; Le-
wak, Marks, & Nelson, 1990; Mosak & Gushust, 1972).

A separate  but  related  claim  is that  assessment  feedback is

Preliminary  findings  from  this study were presented  at  the  25th
Annual Symposium on Recent Developments in the Use of the MMPI
(MMPI-2), June 23,1990, Minneapolis,  Minnesota.  The research was
conducted  in  partial  fulfillment  of  Mary Tonsager's  MA degree  re-
quirements, under the supervision of Stephen E. Finn.

itself  therapeutic  for clients. Lewak and  his colleagues (1990)
believed that the sharing of the test results can improve clients'
mental health when clients are encouraged to actively partici-
pate in their MMPI or MMPI-2 feedback sessions. Many clini-
cians  have  also  reported  that  following  a  feedback  session
clients describe a sense of relief that someone has finally under-
stood their problems (Berg, 1985; Craddick, 1975; Dana, 1982;
Dana & Leech, 1974; Fischer, 1986). Drawing on clinical experi-
ence, Finn and Butcher (1991) have summarized client benefits
following a feedback session as including (a) an increase in self-
esteem, (b) reduced feelings of isolation, (c) increased feelings of
hope, (d) decreased  symptomatology, (e) greater self-awareness
and understanding, and (f) increased  motivation to seek men-
tal  health  services  or  more  actively  participate  in  on-going
therapy.

Unfortunately, there has been no direct evidence supporting
the claims of benefits  from  personality test  feedback. Almost
all research studies on test feedback have examined the  effects
of providing false personality feedback or Barnum statements
to research subjects. (For a detailed review of false personality
feedback  studies,  see  Furnham  &  Schofield,  1987; Snyder,
Shenkel, & Lowery, 1977.) After  reviewing the  numerous  feed-
back  studies,  Furnham  and  Schofield (1987) questioned  the
relevance of the  false  feedback studies to actual  clinical phe-
nomena.  In addition,  Dana  (1982) raised  a number of ethical
concerns  about  the numerous studies using college students as
subjects  in  false feedback studies, because they may be  future
consumers of psychological  services.

In contrast,  only a handful  of studies  have investigated  the
effects of honest personality  feedback, which is more typically
the  practice  in  the  clinical  situation.  Comer  (1965) hypothe-
sized  that  college  students  who received  MMPI test feedback
before  beginning  7 weeks of individual  psychotherapy  would
show more change in therapy than  would those students who
did not receive test feedback. On the basis of the client's change

scores on three MMPI supplemental scales, Comer  found  no
significant  differences  between groups, but the clients' accep-
tance of the  MMPI test  results was overwhelmingly  positive,
and in a follow-up questionnaire they reported that the written
feedback  provided  them  with  a good  basis for discussion  in
therapy  and  helped  them  establish  a  relationship  with  their
therapist.

Although  Comer's (1965)  results were  inconclusive,  his  re-
search provided the first empirical test of personality test  feed-
back as a therapeutic aid to brief time-limited psychotherapy.
His  failure  to  demonstrate an  effect  of MMPI  feedback  may
have been due to several limitations in this study: a small  sam-
ple,  measuring therapeutic change with scales that are not  sen-
sitive to change, the format of the test feedback, and the use of
the MMPI as the therapeutic intervention as well as the instru-
ment  measuring change—thus confounding Comer's conclu-
sions.

In  summary,  the therapeutic impact of sharing information
with  clients about their psychological test results is largely im-
pressionistic and anecdotal, and there are no controlled studies
demonstrating that clients benefit from  test feedback. Four ba-
sic questions guided the research: Does telling clients their test
results benefit  them? If so, what are the benefits of test feedback
and how long do they persist? If benefits occur, which aspect of
the  feedback  session  was responsible for these changes? And
last, if test feedback  is beneficial, which clients benefit  most?
This study investigated the therapeutic impact of providing
feedback  from  the  Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven-
tory-2 (MMPI-2) to college students currently waiting for  men-
tal  health services. The MMPI-2 was chosen  for a number of
reasons:  First,  the  MMPI  is  the  most  widely  used  and  re-
searched  objective  test  of  personality  (Lubin,  Larsen,  Mata-
razzo, & Seever, 1985;  Piotrowski & Keller, 1989), and  it  pro-
vides a  great  deal of  information  concerning an  individual's
personality style, defenses, and  awareness of psychological is-
sues. Second, the ease of administration and automated scoring
of the MMPI-2 (through the National Computer Systems) made
it an ideal instrument to use.  Third, a number of clinicians and
researchers have claimed that their respective clients have bene-
fited from  hearing MMPI-2 test results (e.g., Finn & Butcher,
1991; Lewak, Marks, & Nelson, 1990).

Subjects

Method

Participants were 61 outpatient clients from the University of Texas'
Counseling and  Mental Health  Center  who were recruited  over a 16-
month  period  during those  times when the  Counseling Center  was
unable to offer immediate services to all clients.1 Because of an error in
completing one of the measures  following the MMPI-2 feedback ses-
sion, one experimental client's scores were dropped from all the analy-
ses.  Of the  remaining 60 clients, 32 were randomly  assigned to  the
experimental group and received  MMPI-2 test feedback, and 28 were
assigned to the attention-only control group. In addition, one client in
the experimental condition  did not return the mailed follow-up ques-
tionnaires, resulting in an overall return rate of 98%.

The final subject count  was 24 women and  8 men in the  MMPI-2
assessment  group and  18  women and  10 men  in  the  attention-only
control group. The groups were not significantly different  in age (M =
23.3, SD = 5.5) or sex composition, nor was the overall percentage of

women  (70%) significantly different  from  the  base  rate  of  women
among clients receiving services at the  University of Texas at Austin
Counseling and Mental Health Center in 1990-1991 (65%).

There were 11 months when requests for services exceeded  available
counselors,  during  which most  clients  were referred to  the Center's
waiting  list.  Intake  workers  randomly  selected  participants  for  the
study from clients who did not require immediate  services at the time
of their initial screening and approached  them about participating in
the study. This excluded clients who were assessed at intake as suicidal,
psychotic, or in danger of causing harm to themselves or  others.

Clients in the experimental condition received the following verbal
and written information from  the intake workers. While they were on
the Center's  waiting list, free psychological  testing would be available
through their participation  in an assessment  research  project.  If they
chose  to participate,  they would complete several standardized  tests,
including the MMPI-2, after which they would receive verbal test feed-
back about  their MMPI-2 results  from  an advanced clinical  psychol-
ogy  graduate  student  (Tonsager).  At the  end  of their participation,
their future therapists  would receive a written MMPI-2 test report.

Clients  in  the  control  group  received  the  following information.
While they were waiting for psychotherapy, they were invited to partici-
pate  in  an  assessment  research  project  being conducted  by an  ad-
vanced  clinical  psychology graduate  student.  They  would  have  the
opportunity to meet on two separate occasions with the examiner and
would  be asked  to  complete  several  standard  questionnaires.  Their
participation  would be very helpful to future students waiting for psy-
chological services at the counseling center.

Both groups of clients were assured that their decision of whether or
not to participate  in the study would in no way influence their receiv-
ing services at the Counseling Center. They were also told that if they
chose to participate,  they were free to withdraw from the study at any
time without penalty. If clients were interested  in participating,  their
names were then given to the examiner, who contacted them within 4
days. Once contacted, all clients agreed to participate.

Design  and  Procedure

To test  whether clients benefited  from  hearing their MMPI-2  test
results, a 2 (Group) X 3 (Time) repeated-measures  design was used. As
noted in Figure 1, the major distinction between these two  conditions
is that experimental clients completed  the MMPI-2 and received ver-
bal MMPI-2 test feedback, whereas control clients completed only the
outcome measures and received examiner attention.

Experimental  condition:  Clients  receiving  MMPI-2  feedback.  At
Time  1, the  examiner conducted  a 30-min  interview, focusing on  the
clients' presenting  problems, and explained  the use and purposes  of
psychological  testing and the MMPI-2. The examiner solicited ques-
tions for the assessment from each client (e.g., what did he or she want
to get out of the assessment?). In addition, clients were reminded  that
they would receive only verbal feedback of their MMPI-2 test  results
and that a written report of these findings would be sent to the univer-
sity counseling center to be used by their future therapists. Following
the interview, each client completed  the MMPI-2 and the other inde-
pendent and dependent measures used in the study.

At Time 2, two weeks later, the examiner met individually with the
clients to discuss their MMPI-2 test findings. Feedback sessions were
conducted  according  to  an  approach  developed  by Finn  (1990)  that
stresses  a  collaborative  model  of  assessment  such  as  described  by
Fischer (1986). The feedback process used is also similar to the method
discussed  by Butcher (1990).  First,  the  examiner  gave each client  a
brief description of the history of the MMPI-2 (e.g., how it was devel-

oped  and is used in a variety of settings). The client's questions for the
assessment  were reviewed, and  if he or she had  new questions,  they
were added  to the  list to be addressed by the  examiner. Then,  each
client  was shown  his  or  her  MMPI-2  profile,  and  the  examiner  ex-
plained the meaning of significant scale elevations and configurations
of the basic scales and content  scales. The clients were encouraged  to
actively  participate  throughout  the  feedback session  by giving their
reactions or feelings to each test finding and helping the examiner to
determine  which results were valid.  Last,  the  results  were summa-
rized, and any remaining questions were addressed.2 After  the  feed-
back session,  clients completed  the  dependent  measures.  At Time 3,
approximately 2 weeks following the feedback session, each client was
mailed  the dependent  measures  used  in  the study, a  letter thanking
them  for their participation,  and a stamped  return envelope.  Clients
were also encouraged  to  write any additional comments  or  observa-
tions about the MMPI-2 feedback session.

Control condition: Clients not  receiving test  feedback.  At Time  1,
clients in the control  group  met individually with the examiner for a
30-min interview to discuss  their current concerns. The examiner in-
formed  each  client that  psychological  testing  should  be  viewed as a
form  of communication;  although  they would not be receiving feed-
back about their own results, their participation  would be very valu-
able in helping future students who waited for mental health  services.
Following the interview, clients  were asked  to complete  the  indepen-
dent  and  dependent  measures  used  in the  study. Two weeks later, at
Time 2, the control group met with the examiner for 30 min to discuss
their current concerns or reactions  to the study. Afterward, they com-
pleted  the  dependent  measures.  At  Time  3,  two  weeks  later,  these
clients were mailed the dependent  measures, a stamped  return enve-
lope, and a letter thanking them for their participation.

There  were no statistically  significant  differences between  the as-
sessment and control  groups in the  number of days between  referral
and the initial interview (M = 6.2), between interview and  feedback/at-
tention sessions (M -  \ 5.7), or between  feedback/ attention and com-
pletion of the follow-up (M = 12.2).

Measures

a  567-item  restandardized  version of  the  MMPI.  Clients'  MMPI-2
profiles were scored and plotted using the National Computer  Scoring
system. The MMPI-2 interpretations and written reports  were based
on material found  in a number of primary sources for MMPI-2 inter-
pretation  (cf. Butcher, 1990; Butcher, Graham, Williams, & Ben-Por-
ath, 1990; Graham,  1990) and  were closely supervised  by Stephen E.
Finn.  To determine  whether the  MMPI-2 profiles of  clients  in  the
experimental group were valid, the following raw score exclusion crite-
ria were used: ? >  30, or L > 10, or F > 21, or K > 26. There were no
invalid MMPI-2 profiles in the sample.

The  MMPI-2 profiles of the 32 clients in the feedback group indi-
cated  that  they  were experiencing significant  psychopathology.  As
shown  in  Table 1, a majority of  the  MMPI-2 profiles  were  character-
ized by clinically significant scale elevations. For example, 91% of  the
sample had  MMPI-2 profiles  with  one or  more clinical scales  above
65T (the generally accepted point of clinical significance), and 75% had
two or more scales above 65T. We also classified the MMPI-2 profiles
by the type of pathology they indicated, according to the scheme devel-
oped  by  Lachar (1974).  Eleven profiles  (34%) were considered  to  re-
flect  primarily  "neurotic"  pathology,  ten  (31%) "psychotic,"  seven
(22%) "characteriological," and  four  (13%)  "indeterminate."

Self-Esteem  Questionnaire.  At Times  1, 2,  and  3, clients'  current
levels of self-esteem  were assessed  by the Cheek and  Buss (1981) Self-
Esteem Questionnaire, a six-item scale that has been found to correlate
.88 with  the  well-known  questionnaire  by Rosenberg (1965). Clients
were asked to rate on a 5-point scale how characteristic  each item was
of  themselves, ranging from  not  at  all characteristic of me  (1) to  very
characteristic of  me (5). Clients' scores  on  the  Self-Esteem Question-
naire  were converted  separately by sex  to  linear  T scores  based  on
means and standard  deviations for a normal college sample (A. Buss,
personal communication, 1991).

Symptom  Check  List-90-Revised.  At  all  three  measurement
points,  clients' current  levels of symptomatic  psychological  distress
were measured by the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R),
which  consists  of 90  items that  reflect  psychopathology  in  terms of
three global  indexes of distress  and  nine primary symptom  dimen-
sions (Derogatis,  1983). Items are answered on a five-point scale rang-
ing from  not at all (0) to extremely (4) in terms of the extent to which
clients were distressed  by that  problem  during the  past  7 days. The
three global indexes are (a) the global severity index (GSI), which com-
bines information on a number of symptoms and intensity of distress,
(b)  the  positive symptom  total,  which  reflects  only  the  number  of
symptoms, and (c) the positive symptom distress index, which is a pure
intensity measure that has been adjusted for the number of symptoms
present. The SCL-90-R has been  proven in a variety of clinical and
medical settings to be  very sensitive to change, and  its GSI score  has
been recommended as a useful  psychotherapy change measure (Dero-
gatis, 1983; Waskow & Parloff,  1975).

The decision of which norms to use in scoring the SCL-90-R is a
complex one, given that Derogatis (1983) did not provide a set of norms
for college-aged students.  In a large scale study (N = 1,928) conducted
at  a college  counseling center,  an  unusually high percentage  (65.1%
men and 62.0% women) of the college-age  students  would have been
classified  as seriously  disturbed  if their SCL-90-R scores had been
based on the  available  adult  psychiatric norms  (Johnson,  Ellison, &
Heikkinen,  1989).  In  addition,  Johnson  and  his  colleagues  found
women to consistently obtain raw scores on the majority of the  SCL-
90-R  scales that  were higher than those of the  men. Because of the
significant  sex differences in  the  SCL-90-R  test  results,  Derogatis
(1983) recommended  that separate sex norms be used to interpret the
scores. Given the lack of norms for a college-age sample and the desire

to combine data  from  both sexes for later analyses, the decision  was
made to convert the clients' raw GSI scores, separately by sex, to linear
rscores based on the sample's mean and standard deviation at Time 1.
Private and public self-consciousness.  Given the assertion  by Finn
and  Butcher (1991) that receiving test  feedback  increases clients' sel f-
awareness, we decided  to evaluate clients' private self-consciousness:
the disposition,  habit, or tendency to  focus  attention on the private,
internal aspects of the self (Buss, 1980,1986). Because individuals with
high scores for this trait repeatedly examine their feelings and motives,
we thought they might benefit  the  most  from  an  MMPI-2 feedback
session.  To measure this trait, we used the Self-Consciousness  Inven-
tory (Fenigstein, Scheier, & Buss, 1975), a 23-item self-report question-
naire that has three underlying factors: private self-consciousness, pub-
lic self-consciousness, and social anxiety. Given the focus of the pres-
ent  study, only the  17 items related  to  self-consciousness were used.
Measurements of public self-consciousness were made for discrimi-
nant  validity  (i.e.,  we did  not expect  them  to  be  related  to  reported
benefits  from  test  feedback). Clients  in  both  groups completed  the
Self-Consciousness  Inventory  at Time  1. The  groups did  not  signifi-
cantly differ on their scores for either private (M=  37.3) or public (M  -
25.4) self-consciousness.

Assessment  Questionnaire.  Because there are  no available scales
for measuring clients' subjective impressions of a test feedback session,
a 30-item self-report Assessment Questionnaire (AQ) was developed
for  this study. The construction  of the AQ was based on the  investiga-
tors' review of the literature, clinical experience, and the solicited writ-
ten comments by a subset of the sample. In writing the  30 face-valid
test  items,  a  theoretical-rational  approach  was  used,  a  method
strongly supported by Jackson (1971) and Burisch (1984). The goal was
to  develop items reflecting whether the  clients  felt  (a) more  hopeful
about their problems or situation, (b) understood by the test findings,
(c) less isolated, (d) respected  and  liked by the examiner, (e) as if they
had gained information about themselves, (f) satisfied with the testing
experience,  and  (g) more motivated  to  seek mental  health services.
Each item was rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from  whether clients
strongly disagreed (1) to strongly agreed (5) with the statement. Thus,
clients'  total scores on the  AQ reflect  the extent to which they  found
the assessment experience to be a positive one. Sample items are pre-
sented in Table 2.

Although clients in the control condition did not participate  in an
MMPI-2 assessment, they did complete other measures and met with
the examiner on several occasions. Thus, a subset of items from the AQ
were given to clients in the control condition to complete at Time 2 and
Time 3. This subset excluded items from Content Areas 2 (feeling un-

derstood  as a  result  of the  MMPI-2 feedback) and  5 (learning new
information about themselves from  the assessment  experience).

Table  2  also  shows  alpha  consistency  coefficients  computed  on
clients'  responses  to that AQ at Time 2. As shown in the  table, Sub-
scales  3, 6,  and  7  had  poor  internal  consistency  reliability among
clients in the feedback condition. Thus, it was decided not to use these
subscales separately in further analyses. The total AQ score (computed
for the experimental group only) showed adequate  reliability for use in
both  between-subject  and  within-subject  analyses  (Helmstadter,
1964). In general, clients in the  feedback condition  who rated  the as-
sessment experience positively at Time 2 also did so at Time 3 (test-re-
test r= .81, p<.001).

Results

Effects  of MMPI-2  Assessment on  Symptomatology
and  Self-Esteem

The first question of the  study was whether completing an
MMPI-2  and  receiving  feedback  about  test  results produced
any significant  changes in clients' functioning.  The two  major
hypotheses  were  that  clients  receiving  MMPI-2  feedback,  as
compared with the attention-only controls, would report (a) sig-
nificant  decrease  in  symptomatic  distress  and  (b)  significant
increase  in  self-esteem.  Given  the  fact  that  GSI and  Self-Es-
teem correlated moderately (N = 60: Time 1: r = —.36; Time 2:
r = —.23; and Time 3: r = —.44), two repeated-measures univar-
iate  analyses  of  variance  (ANOVAs)  were  conducted:  a  2
(Group)  X 3  (Time)  with  GSI  and  Self-Esteem  scores  as  the
dependent variables in the respective analyses.

Symptomatology.  For GSI scores from  the SCL-90-R, the
ANOVA  revealed  a  significant  Group  X  Time  interaction,
F(2,54)  = 6.44, p < .01, and a significant main effect  for Time,
F(2,54) =  17.17, p  < .001.  As shown in Figure 2, clients who
completed  an  MMPI-2  and  heard  their  MMPI-2  test  results
showed a significant drop in their self-reported levels of symp-
tomatic distress compared with clients receiving attention only.
This drop was sizable, approaching an effect size of 1. Given the
robust  omnibus  F  value,  t tests were conducted  to  pinpoint
when  the  two  groups  significantly  differed  in  terms of  their
level of distress. Although there were no significant  differences
between  the  two groups at  the  time of the  initial  interview,
Time 1: f(58) = -1.29, ns, or following their respective feedback
or attention-only session, Time 2: t(56) = .57, ns, the  feedback
group reported significantly  less symptomatic distress than did
the  attention  group at  the  2-week  follow-up,  Time 3: /(57) =
2.98,  p  < .01. There was no significant  decrease in the  atten-
tion-only group's GSI scores across time.

Self-esteem.  A similar result was obtained for self-esteem.
The repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant  effect for
Group X Time, F(2,56)  = 9.02, p < .001. As illustrated in Fig-
ure  3, the  two groups of clients did  not  significantly  differ  in
self-esteem  at the  time of the  initial  interview, Time 1: /(58) =
-1.3,  ns. However,  clients  who completed  the  MMPI-2  and

nonclient college students (M  = 50, SD = 10). In contrast, the
attention-only group reported a progressive, although not signif-
icant, decline in self-esteem across time.

Hope.  Finn and Butcher (1991) stated  that after a test  feed-
back session  clients often  feel  more hopeful about their  prob-
lems. Although baseline  ratings of hope  were not collected at
Time  1,  the  Hope  subscale  of  the  AQ provides  an  indirect
method of testing Finn and Butcher's assertion. The Hope sub-
scale  is one  that showed  reliability  that  was good  enough  to
permit between-group comparisons. Experimental and control
clients'  ratings of  hopefulness were compared  at Time 2 and
Time 3. As shown in Table 3, directly after their MMPI-2 feed-
back  session,  clients  in  the  experimental  condition  showed
more hope about  their problems  than did clients in the atten-
tion-only group, and  this persisted  over the 2-week follow-up.
Although these group differences cannot  be tied directly to the
MMPI-2 feedback session, because of the absence of ratings at
Time  1, a finding of no  difference  between the  groups would
have directly challenged  Finn and Butcher's (1991) assertion.

Feelings about the examiner.  Another reliable  subscale  of
the AQ allows a test of a competing hypothesis:  that clients in
the experimental group improved relative to the control  group
because they felt more attended to or liked by the examiner. We
examined clients' ratings of the examiner on Subscale  4 of the
AQ, Examiner Relationship,  which assessed  whether a client
felt accepted, liked, and  respected  by the examiner. As shown
in  Table  3,  there  was  no  significant difference  in  clients'  re-
sponses between the two conditions. Both groups of clients  felt
very  well liked  and  attended  to  by the  examiner, and  these
feelings persisted over the 2-week follow-up. Thus, the benefits
experienced  by clients in the  MMPI-2  feedback condition  do
not appear to be simply a function of feeling liked, accepted, or
cared  for by the examiner.

tion and  verbal feedback may be responsible  for the  reported
significant changes in the experimental  group.

Time  between  testing  and  follow-up.  We  first  questioned
whether there was a relationship  between  the amount of time
between testing (Time 1) and  postfeedback follow-up (Time 3)
and the reported changes in symptomatic distress and self-es-
teem. To test this possibility, we created  change scores on the
GSI and Self-Esteem Questionnaire  by subtracting the  clients'
scores at Time  1 from  their scores at Time  3. Correlations  of
change scores with the number of days elapsed between Time 1
and  Time  3  showed  no  support  for the  suggestion  that  the
length of time was related to the overall drop in symptomatol-
ogy, r(31) = —.04, ns, or increase in self-esteem, r(31) =  —. 12, ns.
Feelings  about  the  assessment.  We  also  predicted  that
clients who experienced the MMPI-2 assessment as more posi-
tive, as indicated by their higher ratings on the AQ, would show
a greater reduction in symptomatology and a greater increase in
self-esteem.  A client's AQ sum  score  following  the  feedback
session  was positively correlated  with the  self-esteem change
scores from testing to feedback, r(25) = .46, p < .01. Also, at the
follow-up,  the AQ sum score was found  to be positively corre-
lated with the overall drop in symptomatology, r(25) = .36, p <
.05, and  increase  in self-esteem: testing to  follow-up,  r(25) =
.37, p < .05; feedback  to follow-up, r(25) = .41, p < .05.

Predictors of Change in the Experimental  Group:
Client Variables

A  final  question was whether certain  types of clients were
more likely to benefit  from  an MMPI-2 assessment  than were
others.

Self-consciousness.  We had  predicted  that  clients  high  in
private self-consciousness were more likely to benefit  from  an
assessment than persons low in private self-consciousness and
that  public  self-consciousness  would  be  unrelated  to  client
change  scores.  Despite  the  fact  that  private  and  public  self-
consciousness were modestly correlated  in our sample, r(29) =
.24, private self-consciousness was found to be strongly related
to a change in symptomatic distress from Time 2 to 3, feedback
to  follow-up;  r(29)  =  .54, p  <  .001,  whereas  public  self-
consciousness showed no significant  relationship to change in
symptomatic distress, r(29) = . 14, ns. In contrast, there was no
significant  relationship between the clients' increase in self-es-

teem  and  their  scores  on  either  the  Private  or  Public  Self-
Consciousness  scales. Thus,  it appears  that  the  more  clients
reported a tendency  to  reflect  on  themselves  and  their inner
worlds prior to participating in the assessment, the greater the
decrease  in their symptomatic distress  following the MMPI-2
feedback session.  Perhaps these clients may have increased  the
most in their self-awareness following the feedback sessions-a
factor Finn and  Butcher (1991) related to positive change.

Severity  and  type  of  psychopathology.  We also  considered
whether the severity and type of psychological disturbance was
related to the significant changes in symptomatic distress and
self-esteem. The two questions being investigated were (a) Are
the clients who are most distressed the most likely to report the
greater  therapeutic  benefits  and  resulting  changes?  (b)  Are
clients diagnosed  with a particular type of psychological dis-
turbance  most  likely  to  benefit  from  the  MMPI-2 feedback
session?

To assess  the  clients'  levels of  psychopathology,  a  supple-
mental scale  from  the MMPI-2 was used: the College  Malad-
justment  (Aft) scale developed by Kleinmuntz (1961). The  Mt
scale  has  been  found  to  measure  severe  psychopathology  in
college students (Wilderman, 1984); thus, it is an ideal instru-
ment  for assessing the  current  level of maladjustment  in  the
sample.  In  addition,  the  Mt  scale  correlates  highly with  the
average elevation of the MMPI-2 profile. Although the Mt scale
was correlated  positively with the clients' GSI scores and nega-
tively with Self-Esteem scores at Time  1, r(32)  = .58,  p  <  .01;
r(32) =  — .53, p < .01, respectively, there was no significant rela-
tionship between Mt scores and change scores in self-esteem or
symptomatology at either Time 2 or Time 3.

It also seemed  possible  that clients with particular  types of
problems might experience the MMPI-2 assessment as more or
less beneficial. In investigating this question, we used  Lachar's
(1974) classification system for MMPI profiles, described  here
earlier. Two one-way ANOVAs were conducted, with the clients'
MMPI-2  Lachar  code  classification  as the  independent  vari-
able and  their overall GSI and  Self-Esteem change as the  re-
spective dependent  variables. There  were no significant  find-
ings  for  these  analyses,  GSI: F(3,27)  =  2.07;  Self-Esteem:
.F(3,27) = 2.80, ns. However, we are aware of the small number
of clients in one of the Lachar classifications (Indeterminate) as
well  as  the  very  wide  standard  deviations  that  this  group

showed  on  Self-Esteem and  GSI  scores  relative to  the  other
three groups.

Attitudes toward mental health professionals.  Last, we con-
sidered  whether clients  who were more  trusting and  positive
toward mental health professionals  were more likely to benefit
from  the  MMPI-2 assessment.  For this purpose,  we relied on
the Negative Treatment Indicators scale (TRT) of the MMPI-2.
This is one of the new MMPI-2 content scales, and it measures a
client's tendency to distrust  and  feel  negatively about mental
health  professionals (Butcher et al.,  1990). We predicted  that
clients  with high scores  on  the  TRT  scale  might  report  less
significant changes following  the MMPI-2 feedback session as
compared  with clients with lower TRT scores. Contrary to our
predictions,  no  significant  relationships  were  observed  be-
tween  clients'  TRT  scores  and  subsequent  change  in  either
symptomatic distress or self-esteem.

Percentage of  Variance in Change  Predicted

The more positively clients  in the experimental  group rated
the assessment experience, the more likely they were to show a
drop  in symptomatic distress  and  an  increase  in self-esteem.
The higher these clients scored on the Private Self-Conscious-
ness scale, indicating a tendency to be reflective and inner di-
rected,  the greater  their decrease  in symptomatology  over the
course of the study. To better quantify our success in predicting
change,  two multiple  regressions were  conducted  on clients'
GSI and Self-Esteem change scores (Time 1 to Time 3), respec-
tively, with AQ Sum scores at Time 2 and Private Self-Conscious-
ness  scores  at  Time  1 entered  as  predictors.  With these  two
variables, we were able to account for 17% of the variance (R =
.41)  in  GSI  change  scores  and  21% (R  = .46)  in Self-Esteem
change scores (df=  2,22 in both regressions, both Fs not signifi-
cant).

Discussion

This study provides support  for the  therapeutic  impact  of
sharing MMPI-2 test results verbally with college-age  clients.
Clients  who  completed  an  MMPI-2  and  later  heard  their
MMPI-2  test  results  reported  a  significant increase  in  their
self-esteem  immediately following the feedback session, an in-
crease that continued to grow over the 2-week follow-up period.
In  addition, after  hearing their  MMPI-2  test  results,  clients
showed  a  significant  decrease  in  their  symptomatic  distress,
and distress continued to decline during the subsequent 2-week
period.  Last,  compared  with clients  receiving attention  only
from  the  examiner, clients  who completed  the  MMPI-2  and
received  a  feedback  session  showed  more  hopefulness  about
their  problems  immediately  following  the  feedback  session,
and this persisted  at the final follow-up.

Experimental  clients'  subjective  impressions  of the  assess-
ment and the MMPI-2 feedback session  were overwhelmingly
positive as measured  by the  Assessment  Questionnaire (AQ).
This and  the  aforementioned  outcome  results  strongly  refute
the assertion of many traditional  assessors that hearing about
test results will necessarily be a frightening and upsetting expe-
rience for clients. The possibility remains, however, that some
methods of test feedback could be upsetting and even damag-

ing to clients. The  particular method of feedback used in  the
current study, with its emphasis on soliciting clients' participa-
tion  in  the  assessment and  collaboratively discussing test  re-
sults, appears to have been well received by clients. On a similar
note, it appears that clients in the attention-only control  group
also experienced the  research experience as positive. This  fact
may help explain the exceptionally high return rate (98%) of the
follow-up questionnaires from  the combined group of clients.
Although the present study clearly documents changes in the
clients'  self-esteem and  symptomatic distress  following  their
MMPI-2 feedback session,  it provides only partial evidence as
to why these changes occurred. There was a moderate relation-
ship between  how positively  clients felt  about  the assessment
experience and how much they improved on symptomatology
and  self-esteem after  the  feedback  session.  Also,  clients who
rated themselves at the inception of the study as more reflective
and thoughtful about their inner experience were more likely to
benefit  from  a feedback  session,  perhaps  because  of a greater
increase  in  self-awareness following  the  test  feedback. Apart
from  these  variables,  however, no  significant predictor  rela-
tionships emerged: Improvement was unrelated to the clients'
initial level of distress on the  MMPI-2; the type of pathology
the  MMPI-2  revealed; their  prior  attitudes  toward  mental
health professionals and mental health services; and the length
of time between testing, feedback, and follow-up. Overall, less
than  a  quarter of  the  variance could  be  predicted  for either
change  in  symptomatology  or  change  in  self-esteem  among
clients receiving test  feedback.

The current study is limited, of course, in its ability to iden-
tify  specific therapeutic elements about test feedback, because
a highly standardized  feedback approach  was used by one ex-
aminer for all clients. Further research needs to focus not only
on replicating the current results but also on identifying  those
aspects of the current feedback method that have specific thera-
peutic value. Identifying such elements might allow for an even
more powerful  feedback method or for a more efficient  method
that minimizes nonessential components.

In the absence of this research, we are left with theory to help
explain the question one of our colleagues put to us: Why does
telling people bad  things about themselves (e.g., that  they are
depressed,  angry,  thought disordered,  or  obsessional)  make
them feel better? Two quite different areas of psychology speak
directly  to  this.  In social  psychology, Swann's self-verification
theory asserts that  individuals seek feedback from  others that
fits their own conceptions of themselves, even if such feedback
is  negative (McNulty &  Swann,  1991; Swann,  1983; Swann,
Stein-Seroussi, & Geisler, 1992). Swann and his colleagues pos-
tulate that although  most individuals desire to be praised  and
feel valued by others, they also want others to see them as they
see themselves,  and  this desire  for self-verification will  often
override the desire for positive self-enhancing feedback (Swann,
Hixon,  Stein-Seroussi,  &  Gilbert,  1990;  Swann,  Wenzlaff,
Krull, &Pelham,  1992).

We believe that our feedback procedure combines aspects of
both self-verification  and self-enhancement. In giving MMPI-2
results  to  clients,  we often  confirmed aspects  of clients'  self-
schemata  that had not been previously  verified by others. The
power  of this seemed  reflected in clients' written  and  verbal
comments after  the  feedback  session.  One  client  wrote, "It is

PROVIDING  MMPI-2  TEST  FEEDBACK

285

relieving to know that most of the criticism and positive aspects
of myself were reflected on the test. It tells me that most of how
I  view  myself is legitimate  and  not  fabrications."  This  same
theme is echoed in another client's comments:  "[The MMPI-2
results]  put  words  to  my  feelings.  It  confirmed  my feelings
about the aspects of my personality that we discussed.  .  .lam
feeling relieved."

In addition to verifying clients' self-conceptions, however, we
offered  them self-enhancing feedback. This aspect  of the  feed-
back was reflected in some direct praise (e.g., we started inter-
pretive sessions by saying something positive to clients, even if
only that they had been cooperative and truthful and that  this
had  been  greatly appreciated).  At times during feedback ses-
sions,  we  offered  positive  interpretations  by  "refraining"
clients' existing self-concepts in light of test results (e.g., a client
who had seen herself as "lazy" because she was having trouble
getting  up  in  the  morning  was told  that  this was actually a
manifestation  of her "depression").  Last,  and  we think most
important, a self-enhancing environment was maintained with
clients  while discussing  their  problems.  As one  client  com-
mented, "I expected such judgment, and I received such com-
passion.  .  .. It makes me think that I am worthy of such com-
passion  from  myself also."

Self-verification  theory  would clearly predict  that  a  proce-
dure  combining  self-verifying  and  self-enhancing feedback
would be highly desired by clients and  that  it would  increase
feelings of well-being. However, Swann and his colleagues have
been  at  a  loss to  say how one  might combine  both  of  these
aspects  for  clients  with  negative  self-views, because  positive
feedback  is often  nonverifying.  We believe  that  by creating a
positive emotional  tone,  while verbally offering self-confirm-
ing (and often  negative) feedback, that our procedure  success-
fully solves this quandary.

We hypothesize, however, an additional  therapeutic  element
to our  feedback  procedure, one that goes slightly beyond  self-
verification  theory as currently stated  by Swann and  his col-
leagues. We suspect  that clients in our study benefited not only
from  having their existing self-schemata verified but also  from
being exposed to additional ways of thinking about themselves
that were new but not in conflict with their existing self-defini-
tions. For example, a client with a 4-3 MMPI-2 code type may
have  already known that  she has  difficulties  sustaining long-
term  relationships and  often  feels cheated by partners.  In our
MMPI-2 feedback session  we would have verified such a self-
schema but also have offered  an additional concept—that such
difficulties  are common among people  with similar MMPI-2
scores because they have severe conflicts about exposing their
dependency needs. We would then have explained the dilemma
of 4-3 clients in greater detail (i.e., that they very much wish to
be taken care of by others but  have great difficulty  asking for
what  they  want in  relationships)  and  have  gone  on  to  make
predictions about which situations might most exacerbate such
conflicts  and  have asked  the  client  to  confirm  or  disconfirm
our  predictions.

We have observed that when such interventions are success-
ful  (i.e., that our hypotheses are both accepted  and confirmed
with additional data by clients), that clients are greatly relieved.
We believe this is because clients have adopted  a higher order
self-definition  that  organizes  disparate  self-perceptions  and

leads  to  predictions  about  how behavior  needs  to change for
problems  to  decrease  (e.g.,  for the  client  with the  4-3  profile,
becoming  more  comfortable  with asking  for things  directly
may  help decrease feelings of being cheated  in  relationships).
We  further  believe  that  this  "naming"  and  "explaining"  of
clients' experiences is one of the major therapeutic elements in
giving test  feedback, in  that  it  helps  to  organize  a  personal
identity. Again, a client  comment seems illustrative:

I  feel  this  testing experience  is positive.  It  is making me  more
aware of who I am—confirming things I know, mostly, but I also
have a few new things to keep in mind and consider... It seems
clearer who I am.

This aspect of our observations seems to fit best with several
psychoanalytic theories, for example, that of Self Psychology, as
put forth by Heinz Kohut and his followers (Kohut, 1977,1984;
Wolf, 1988). Self Psychology  would probably see our test  feed-
back  sessions  as an  intense  experience  of "positive,  accurate
mirroring"—a normal developmental experience of which self
psychologists  would assert  most people seeking mental health
services  have had  little.  Self psychologists  might predict  that
our feedback procedure actually helps stabilize and strengthen
clients'  "self-structures,"  and  that  after  a  feedback  session,
clients should feel less anxious and less worried about  "disinte-
grating" (i.e., having their  self-schemata  dissolve in the  face of
stress or conflicting  information).

This theory also resembles that of psychoanalyst Harry Stack
Sullivan (1953a, 1953b), who stressed  the drive of all persons to
maintain their "self-system"—those thoughts and conceptions
that define one's identity and protect  one's self-esteem. Sullivan
felt that  the self-system was most  likely to change through an
experience  of "closeness" and "good will" between  therapist
and client, in which the therapist "spreads a larger context be-
fore" the client, "whereupon,  in spite of anxiety .  .  . the  self-
system can be modified" (Sullivan, 1953b, p. 302).

In conclusion, the present study provides support for the as-
sertion that test feedback itself is therapeutic to clients. Further
research  is needed to replicate the current findings, to investi-
gate further which aspects of the current assessment were bene-
ficial and to correct  some of the limitations in this study's de-
sign. In this latter area, future research should separate the ad-
ministration of the MMPI-2 and the giving of test feedback. In
the current study, clients in the control group were not adminis-
tered the MMPI-2 because of the shortage of staff and what we
view as an ethical necessity: to give feedback to every client who
participates in testing. We were willing to make this concession
in the design, although it necessarily confounds test feedback
with the administration of the MMPI-2, because we thought it
unlikely that completing an MMPI-2 would be in itself of thera-
peutic value. If this were the  case,  it seems very likely that it
would have been noticed by now in the many therapy-outcome
and other clinical studies in which the MMPI has been  used.
However, in future research, this deserves to be tested explicitly.
It is possible,  for example, that completing the MMPI-2 in the
context  of  waiting for  psychotherapy  is especially  helpful  to
clients-it  may make  them  feel  that  they  are  contributing  to
their  treatment and  thus lead  to more hope and  less distress
about their situation. We are at present undertaking a study that
separates  the administration  of the MMPI-2 and the giving of
test feedback.

Considering psychological  assessment to be a therapeutic in-
tervention  is a major paradigm  shift in how assessment  is typi-
cally  viewed.  Historically,  psychological  assessment,  particu-
larly  the  MMPI,  has  been  used  primarily  for diagnosis  and
treatment planning by clinicians or for evaluating the success of
an intervention  after it has occurred. The current study would
suggest  that  these  uses of assessment  can still be valuable but
that  the  impact  of assessment  does not stop there.  As the in-
scription over the oracle at Delphi instructed,  it is important  to
"know thyself." This study suggests just how valuable and bene-
ficial such knowledge can be.

The Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied will publish original empirical investi-
gations in experimental psychology that bridge practically oriented problems and psycho-
logical theory.  The journal also will publish research aimed at developing and testing of
models of cognitive processing or behavior in applied situations, including laboratory and
field  settings.  Review  articles will  be considered  for  publication  if  they  contribute
significantly to important topics within applied experimental  psychology.

Areas of interest include applications of perception, attention, decision making, reasoning,
information processing,  learning, and performance.  Settings may be industrial (such as
human-computer interface design), academic (such as intelligent computer-aided instruc-
tion), or consumer oriented  (such as applications  of text comprehension  theory to the
development or evaluation of product instructions).

First review of nominations will begin December  15,1992.
