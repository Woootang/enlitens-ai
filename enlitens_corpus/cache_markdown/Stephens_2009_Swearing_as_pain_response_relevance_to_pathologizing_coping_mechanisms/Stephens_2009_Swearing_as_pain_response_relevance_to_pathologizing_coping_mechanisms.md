DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This research article investigates the common assumption that swearing is a maladaptive 
response to pain. The study finds the opposite is true: swearing significantly increases pain 
tolerance and decreases perceived pain, likely by inducing a fight-or-flight response. This is 
critically relevant to Enlitens' mission as it provides direct evidence against pathologizing 
unconventional coping mechanisms and supports the principle that behaviors often deemed 
"maladaptive" can have a valid, functional, and neurobiological basis.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Anecdotally (we found no supporting evidence in the literature), some pain theorists 
view swearing as a sign of 'pain-related catastrophising', which may be defined as a 
maladaptive response in which negative and unhelpful thoughts and ideas are brought to
bear when pain is experienced [6]."

● "We wondered why swearing, a supposedly maladaptive response to pain, is such a 

common pain response."

● "we carried out an experiment to test the as yet unvalidated hypothesis that swearing, 
being a maladap- tive response to pain, would decrease pain tolerance and increase 
pain perception compared with not swearing."

● "Swearing increased pain tolerance, increased heart rate and decreased perceived pain 

compared with not swearing."

● "This experiment tested the hypothesis that swearing, an assumed maladaptive pain 

response, would decrease pain tolerance and increase pain perception compared with 
not swearing. In fact, the opposite occurred - people withstood a moderately to strongly 
painful stimulus for significantly longer if they repeated a swear word rather than a 
nonswear word."

● "We interpret these data as indicating that swearing. rather than being a maladaptive 

pain response actually produces a hypoalgesic (pain lessening) effect."

● "Fear of pain predicted perceived pain in the nonswearing condition, consistent with 
previous research [20]. However, fear of pain did not predict perceived pain in the 
swearing condition. This interesting finding suggests that a part of the hypoalgesic effect 
of swearing may be because of the amelioration of that part of increased pain perception
that is brought about by fear of pain, although further research would be required to 
investigate this further."

● "In considering its neurobiological underpinnings Pinker [4] suggests that swearing aloud

may tap into deep and ancient parts of the emotional brain', particularly the limbic 
system and the basal ganglia of the right hemisphere."

● "Rhudy and Meagher [21,22] suggest that hypoalgesia occurs only if the negative 

emotion experienced in the context of a painful stimulus is sufficiently strongly felt to 
cause fear rather than anxiety."

● "The heart rate acceleration after swearing observed in this study is consistent with 

activation of the fight or flight response."

● "Swearing in these contexts may serve to raise levels of aggression, downplaying 

feebleness in favour of a more pain-tolerant machismo, most likely mediated by classic 
fight or flight mechanisms [24]."

● "This study has shown that, under certain conditions, swearing produces a hypoalgesic 

effect."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Overall Effect of Swearing: Swearing increased pain tolerance, increased heart rate, 

and decreased perceived pain compared with not swearing.

● Cold-Pressor Latency (Pain Tolerance):

○ There was a main effect of swearing, with longer latencies (higher tolerance) in 

the swearing condition (
F(1.65)=89.749, P<0.001).

○ There was a main effect of sex, with longer latencies in males than females (

F(1.65)=11.789, P=0.001).

○ Swearing Condition (males): 190.63 seconds.
○ Nonswearing Condition (males): 146.71 seconds.
○ Swearing Condition (females): 120.29 seconds.
○ Nonswearing Condition (females): 83.28 seconds.

● Perceived Pain:

○ There was a main effect of swearing, with lower perceived pain in the swearing 

condition (
F(1.65)=98.569, P<0.001).

○ A significant swearing by sex interaction was found (

F(1.65)=9.159, P=0.004).

○ Both sexes experienced a reduction in perceived pain while swearing, but 

females did so to a greater extent.

● Heart Rate:

○ There was a main effect of swearing, with heart rate increasing in the swearing 

condition (
F(1.65)=150.774, P<0.001).

○ A significant swearing by sex interaction was found (

F(1.65)=15.019, P<0.001).

○ Swearing increased heart rate in both sexes, but more so for females compared 

with males.

● Interaction with Catastrophising:

○ The three-way interaction of swearing, sex, and catastrophising significantly 

predicted cold-pressor latency (
F(1.63)=7.754, P=0.007).

○ Catastrophising predicted decreased pain tolerance (latency) in swearing males 

but not in nonswearing males or in females.

● Interaction with Fear of Pain:

○ The fear of pain by swearing interaction predicted perceived pain (

F(1.64)=5.621, P=0.021).

○ Fear of pain predicted perceived pain in the nonswearing condition but not in the 

swearing condition.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

● Design: A repeated measures design was used where pain outcomes were assessed in 
participants who were asked to repeat a swear word versus a neutral word. Condition 
order was randomized.

● Participants: 67 undergraduate students (38 males, 29 females). The Keele University 

School of Psychology Research Ethics Committee approved the study.

● Word Selection: Participants were asked for 'five words you might use after hitting 

yourself on the thumb with a hammer' and used the first swear word on the list. For a 
control, they were asked for 'five words to describe a table' and used the word whose 
position corresponded with the swear word.

● Pain Induction (Cold-Pressor Task): The 'cold pressor' paradigm was employed.
This laboratory procedure requires participants to submerge one hand in ice-
cold water (
5∘C) until discomfort necessitates removal. Submersion latency is recorded 
as an index of pain tolerance. A 5-minute time limit was imposed.

● Measurements:

○ Pain Tolerance: Measured as the submersion latency in the cold-pressor task.
○ Pain Perception: Assessed using the Perceived Pain Scale (PPS) immediately 

after each cold-pressor submersion.

○ Heart Rate: Measured using a Polar FS1 monitor to assess autonomic arousal. It

was recorded at rest and at the end of each cold-pressor submersion.

○ Covariates: The study measured and controlled for pain catastrophising, fear of 
pain, and trait anxiety. The Pain Catastrophising Questionnaire, the Fear of Pain 
Questionnaire Version 3, and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index were 
administered at the start of the session.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

● Hypoalgesia via Fight-or-Flight Response: The paper theorizes that the pain-

lessening (hypoalgesic) effect of swearing occurs because it induces a fight-or-flight 

response. The observed increase in heart rate during the swearing condition is 
consistent with the activation of this response.

● Neurobiology of Swearing and Emotion: The discussion cites Pinker's suggestion that
"swearing aloud may tap into deep and ancient parts of the emotional brain', particularly 
the limbic system and the basal ganglia of the right hemisphere." This connects the act 
of swearing to core emotional processing centers.

● Fear vs. Anxiety in Pain Perception: The paper draws on the work of Rhudy and 

Meagher, who propose that hypoalgesia (pain reduction) occurs when a negative 
emotion is strong enough to cause fear (an immediate alarm reaction to present threat), 
which activates a fight-or-flight response. This is contrasted with anxiety (a future-
oriented emotion), which leads to hypervigilance. The authors suggest swearing may 
induce an immediate alarm reaction similar to fear.

● Aggression as a Mediator: The paper speculates that aggression may be the specific 

emotion elicited by swearing that produces the hypoalgesic effect. "Swearing in these 
contexts may serve to raise levels of aggression, downplaying feebleness in favour of a 
more pain-tolerant machismo, most likely mediated by classic fight or flight mechanisms 
[24]."

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

● Overall Sex Differences:

○ Males showed longer pain tolerance (cold-pressor latency) than females in both 

swearing and nonswearing conditions.

○ While both sexes experienced reduced perceived pain when swearing, females 

showed a greater reduction.

○ While both sexes showed an increased heart rate when swearing, females 

showed a greater increase.

● Sex Differences in Catastrophising:

○ Females reported significantly higher scores on the Catastrophising Score and 

Fear of Pain score than males.

○ The hypoalgesic effect of swearing was present in females regardless of their 

tendency to catastrophise.

○ In males, the hypoalgesic effect of swearing "dissipated as the tendency to 

catastrophise increased."

○ The study confirmed previous findings that male participants generally showed 

lower levels of catastrophising than females.

● Sex Differences in Fear of Pain:

○ Fear of pain predicted decreased pain tolerance (latency) in males but not in 

females.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

● Challenging Pathologization: This study provides direct evidence to challenge the view

of swearing as merely a "maladaptive" or "catastrophising" response to pain. It 
demonstrates a clear, measurable, and positive function (pain reduction).

● Understanding Coping Mechanisms: The findings suggest that swearing is a 
functional coping mechanism that nullifies the link between fear of pain and the 

perception of pain. It activates the body's natural pain-inhibitory systems via the fight-or-
flight response.

● Conclusion: "This study has shown that, under certain conditions, swearing produces a 

hypoalgesic effect. Swearing may have induced a fight or flight response and we 
speculate on a role for aggression in this. In addition swearing nullified the link between 
fear of pain and pain perception."
