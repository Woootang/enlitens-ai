This paper introduces the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), a diagnostic tool designed to probe 
students' "commonsense beliefs" about physics versus the formal Newtonian concepts taught in
class. It provides powerful evidence that traditional instruction is "almost totally ineffective" 
because it fails to engage with these pre-existing belief systems, leading students to rote 
memorization rather than true comprehension. The authors argue that these commonsense 
beliefs are not mere errors but coherent, reasonable hypotheses grounded in experience that 
must be respected and addressed, a core principle that directly supports the Enlitens mission of 
validating lived experience over pathologizing it.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Every student begins physics with a well-established system of commonsense beliefs 

about how the physical world works derived from years of personal experience."

● "Instruction that does not take them into account is almost totally ineffective, at least for 

the majority of students."

● "Specifically, it has been established that¹ (1) commonsense beliefs about motion and 
force are incompatible with Newtonian concepts in most respects, (2) conventional 
physics instruction produces little change in these beliefs, and (3) this result is 
independent of the instructor and the mode of instruction."

● "Since the students have evidently not learned the most basic Newtonian concepts, they 
must have failed to comprehend most of the material in the course. They have been 
forced to cope with the subject by rote memorization of isolated fragments and by 
carrying out meaningless tasks."

● "effective instruction requires more than dedication and subject knowledge. It requires 

technical knowledge about how students think and learn."

● "The first impression of most physics professors is that the Inventory questions are too 
trivial to be informative. This turns to shock when they discover how poorly their own 
students perform on it."

● "The commonsense alternatives to the Newtonian concepts are commonly labeled as 
misconceptions. They should nevertheless be accorded the same respect we give to 
scientific concepts."

● "Accordingly, these commonsense beliefs should be regarded as reasonable 

hypotheses grounded in everyday experience. They happen to be false, but that is not 
always so easy to prove, especially if they are dismissed without a hearing as ill 
conventional instruction."

● "The Inventory, therefore, is not a test of intelligence; it is a probe of belief systems."
● "We have no reason to suspect that better results will be found at typical high schools 

anywhere in the United States."

● "Thus, we have the incredible result of nearly identical post test scores for seven 

different professors (with more than a thousand students)."

● "It is hard to imagine stronger statistical evidence for the original conclusion that 

Diagnostic posttest scores for conventional instruction are independent of the instructor."

● "It is no longer acceptable to blame low post test scores on poor background of the 

students. The main deficiency is likely to be in the instruction."

● "Conventional instruction does work for some students, but at best it is slow and 

inefficient."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Failure of Conventional Instruction: Data showed that conventional instruction 
produces little change in students' commonsense beliefs, a result found to be 
independent of the instructor or specific mode of instruction.

● Instructor Independence: The post-test scores for a university physics course were 
nearly identical across seven different professors and over a thousand students, 
suggesting the instructional method was the limiting factor, not the instructor. The 
pre/post scores for this course on the Inventory were 52%/63% and on a similar test, the
Diagnostic, they were 51%/64%.

● Lack of Correlation with Teacher Competence: In a study of 18 high school teachers, 

there was no correlation between teacher competence (ranked by academic 
background, diagnostic scores, and experience) and their students' post-test scores.
● Lack of Correlation with Math Skills: Student scores on a math test had no significant 
correlation with their scores on the FCI, indicating that math background was not a major
factor in understanding physics concepts.

● Conceptual Threshold: The data suggests a conceptual threshold around 60% on the 
Inventory. Below this score, "a student's grasp of Newtonian concepts is insufficient for 
effective problem solving". High school courses with post-test scores below 60% on the 
Inventory also had uniformly low scores on the problem-solving Baseline test.

● Graduate Student Misconceptions: Interviews with 16 first-year physics graduate 
students revealed that only two had a perfect understanding of the concepts on the 
Inventory. Several retained fundamental misconceptions about Newton's Third Law and 
impetus, and every student but two had a deficient understanding of buoyancy.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Commonsense Belief Systems vs. Newtonian Concepts

The paper's central framework is the distinction between a student's pre-existing, experience-
based "commonsense belief system" and the formal "Newtonian conceptual system." The FCI is
designed to probe which system a student uses to answer questions.

● Commonsense Beliefs are Coherent: These beliefs are not random errors but are 

often part of a coherent, metaphorical, and reasonable (though scientifically incorrect) 
system. They include concepts like "impetus" and "active force".

● Impetus: The belief that an inanimate "motive power" or "intrinsic force" keeps things 
moving. This belief contradicts Newton's First Law. Evidence for this belief system is a 
sign that the First Law is not understood.

● Active Force: The belief that force is attributed only to "active agents" (like living things) 
and acts via direct contact to create motion. This leads to the commonsense idea that 
"motion implies active force".

● Dominance Principle: In an interaction, the "more forceful" object (bigger, more 

massive, more active) exerts a greater force. This belief is so natural and strongly held 
that it is one of the last misconceptions to be overcome, persisting even in some 
graduate students.

● The Inventory as a Probe: The FCI is explicitly described as a "probe of belief 
systems," not a test of intelligence. Its "errors" are more informative than correct 
answers, as they reveal the underlying commonsense reasoning a student is using.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) Design

● Purpose: To probe student beliefs about force and compare them with the Newtonian 

concept of force.

● Format: A multiple-choice test that requires a "forced choice between Newtonian 

concepts and commonsense alternatives".

● Structure: The test decomposes the Newtonian concept of force into six conceptual 

dimensions: Kinematics, First Law, Second Law, Third Law, Superposition Principle, and
Kinds of Force. Each dimension is probed by multiple questions.

● Distractors: The incorrect answer choices ("distractors") are designed to correspond to 

specific, common-sense misconceptions, as detailed in a taxonomy.

● Validity: The authors established validity through extensive interviews with students at 
high school and graduate levels to confirm that their choices on the test reflected their 
underlying reasoning. They found that non-Newtonian choices were rarely made by 
students with the relevant Newtonian concept, but Newtonian choices for non-Newtonian
reasons were fairly common, meaning the score is an
 upper bound on understanding.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Uses for the Inventory

The paper outlines three main uses for the FCI, which can be analogized to Enlitens' approach:

1. As a Diagnostic Tool: The Inventory identifies and classifies misconceptions, raising 
awareness for the teacher (or clinician) of their students' (or clients') thinking. The 
greatest insight comes from using the inventory as a basis for interviews, asking 
individuals to explain their reasoning. This interview technique can be transformed into a
group discussion to induce conceptual change.

2. For Evaluating Instruction: The FCI is an accurate and reliable instrument for 

measuring the effectiveness of an instructional method. The authors argue that low post-
test scores should no longer be blamed on student background, but on the instruction 
itself.

3. As a Placement Exam: It can be used to determine if a student's conceptual 

understanding is sufficient for more advanced work. It should
 not be used as a test of ability to place beginning students into different tracks (e.g., 
Regular vs. Honors).

How to Overcome Misconceptions

● Avoid a Piecemeal Approach: Simply telling students about their individual 

misconceptions is ineffective. Misconceptions can only be overcome when a "better 
(namely, Newtonian concepts) is available to replace them". The focus should be on 
teaching a coherent, unitary conceptual system.

● Systematic Engagement: The instructor must anticipate when discussions of specific 
misconceptions will be most fruitful, focus student attention on crucial issues, and bring 
the discussion to a satisfying closure. This requires planning and practice.

● Address Core Beliefs: The most difficult and persistent misconceptions are the 

"impetus concept" and the "Dominance principle". Unless dealt with effectively, they can 
persist even into graduate school.

● Develop Foundational Skills First: Problem-solving instruction is not effective until 

certain concepts and reasoning modes are developed, including skills in graphical and 
diagrammatic representations.
