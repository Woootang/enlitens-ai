DOCUMENT SUMMARY This longitudinal study demonstrates that the social-emotional skill of 
empathy, developed in early adolescence, is a significant predictor of long-term physical health. 
Following a predominantly Black sample from age 13 to 27, the research finds that higher 
empathy predicts slower epigenetic (cellular) aging. This protective effect is explained by 
behavior: more empathic teens grew up to use less tobacco, which in turn led to better 
biological health, providing a clear pathway of how prosocial traits become biologically 
embedded.

Adolescent Empathy and Epigenetic 
Aging in Adulthood: Substance Use as a 
Mediator

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper provides powerful evidence for our holistic, bio-psycho-social model by 
demonstrating that a "soft skill" like empathy has hard, measurable biological consequences 
over a decade later. It perfectly illustrates how a psychological strength developed in 
adolescence can serve as a protective factor, shaping behavior and ultimately becoming 
embedded in an individual's biology through epigenetic mechanisms.

The study's longitudinal design, its focus on a predominantly Black population, and its 
successful identification of a specific mechanism (tobacco use) make it a cornerstone piece of 
evidence for our work. It supports our strengths-based approach by framing empathy as a 
health-promoting asset and validates our focus on the whole person by showing a clear 
pathway from social-emotional functioning to health-risk behavior to cellular aging.

Critical Statistics for Our Work

Study Population & Design

● Sample: 343 individuals from a longitudinal study.
● Demographics: 81% Black, 19% White; 58% female.
● Timeline: Empathy was assessed at mean age 13 (Time 1), substance use at mean 
ages 17 (Time 2) and 27 (Time 3), and epigenetic aging at mean age 27 (Time 3).

Key Findings on Empathy, Behavior, and Aging

● Direct Effect of Empathy on Aging: Higher empathy in early adolescence uniquely 

predicted slower epigenetic aging on the GrimAge clock in young adulthood. This was 
true even after adjusting for parental nurturance, violence exposure, family income, sex, 
and race.

● The Mediating Role of Tobacco Use: The relationship between higher empathy and 

slower epigenetic aging was explained by lower tobacco use.

○ Empathy -> Behavior: Higher empathy at age 13 predicted significantly lower 

tobacco use across late adolescence and young adulthood. It did not significantly
predict alcohol or cannabis use in the final models.

○ Behavior -> Biology: Higher tobacco use, in turn, predicted accelerated 
epigenetic aging across all three clocks (GrimAge, DunedinPACE, and 
PhenoAge).

● The Full Pathway: A significant indirect effect was found: higher empathy at age 13 led 

to lower tobacco use, which in turn led to slower aging on all three epigenetic clocks in 
young adulthood.

Methodology We Can Learn From

● Longitudinal Mediation Model: The study uses a powerful longitudinal design to test a 
mediation pathway. This allows for an examination of how an early life factor (empathy) 
influences a later-life outcome (epigenetic aging) by testing the role of an intermediate 
factor (substance use). This method provides stronger evidence for a causal chain than 
cross-sectional analysis.

● Cumulative Substance Use: Rather than looking at a single time point, the study 
created a cumulative index of substance use by averaging measures from late 
adolescence (age 17) and young adulthood (age 27). This captures a more stable 
pattern of behavior over a critical developmental period.

● Modern Epigenetic Clocks: The study utilized three second- and third-generation 
epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, DunedinPACE, and PhenoAge), which are considered 
better biomarkers for health and mortality risk because they were validated against 
clinical health indicators, not just chronological age.

Findings That Challenge the System

● Social-Emotional Skills are Health Interventions: This research reframes empathy 
from a simple "character trait" into a key predictor of long-term physical health. It 
provides evidence that fostering social-emotional skills in adolescents is a legitimate 
public health strategy with tangible biological benefits that manifest over a decade later.
● Behavior is the Bridge Between Psyche and Soma: The successful mediation model 

offers a clear, data-driven example of the mind-body connection. It shows how a 
psychological trait (empathy) influences a behavioral choice (to smoke or not), which 
then directly alters biology at a cellular level (epigenetic aging). This supports a holistic, 
integrated view of health over a siloed one.

● A Strengths-Based Protective Pathway: In contrast to a deficit-based model that 

focuses on risk factors, this study identifies and quantifies a protective pathway. It 
demonstrates how a positive prosocial trait (empathy) reduces engagement in a major 
health-risk behavior, leading to a positive health outcome.

Populations Discussed

● Racially Diverse Youth: A major strength of the study is its sample, which was 81% 

Black. This provides crucial insights into developmental health pathways in a population 
that is often underrepresented in longitudinal research and faces significant health 
disparities.

● Adolescents and Young Adults: The study tracks individuals through early 

adolescence (age 13), late adolescence (age 17), and young adulthood (age 27), 
capturing two critical developmental periods for both social-emotional growth and the 
establishment of health-related behaviors.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the core finding: "This study suggests that adolescents with higher empathy have 

better health status in the form of slower cellular aging in young adulthood".
● On the mechanism: "Tobacco use presents a mechanism for this relationship as 

adolescents with higher empathy used less tobacco from late adolescence to adulthood, 
which then contributed to better health and less cellular aging in adulthood".

● On the direct link: "...higher empathy in early adolescence uniquely predicted lower 
epigenetic aging on the GrimAge clock in young adulthood even after adjusting for 
environmental and sociodemographic risk factors".

● On the mediation finding: "Mediation models revealed that the link between empathy and

lower epigenetic aging on all three clocks was mediated by lower tobacco use".

● On the implications: "These results suggest that higher empathy during early 

adolescence may contribute to better health throughout the lifespan due to lower 
tobacco use and slower epigenetic aging".

Clinical Implications

● Empathy as Health Promotion: The findings strongly suggest that promoting empathy 
in youth is a viable strategy for improving long-term physical health and increasing 
longevity.

● Informing Prevention Programs: Interventions aimed at preventing smoking could be 
made more effective by incorporating modules designed to build empathy. The study 
suggests empathy helps youth better consider the long-term consequences of their 
actions and the potential harm to others (e.g., via secondhand smoke), which may 
strengthen their resolve to avoid tobacco.

● The Importance of Social-Emotional Learning (SEL): School-based SEL programs 
that foster empathy could be viewed not just as tools for improving social behavior, but 
as critical public health interventions that contribute to better epigenetic health outcomes
later in life.
