DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This research article investigates the relationship between creativity and the two most 
prevalent presentations of ADHD in adults: predominantly inattentive (ADHD-I) and 
combined (ADHD-C). The study found that the ADHD-C group reported higher self-
rated creativity and produced more original and abstract drawings compared to controls.
The authors conclude that higher creativity in the ADHD-C presentation is more strongly
associated with the severity of ADHD symptoms, particularly hyperactivity, rather than 
deficits in executive inhibition.

Abstract

Objective: ADHD and its associated inhibition deficits might promote creativity. 
However, results in the literature are conflicting, possibly due to the heterogeneity of 
ADHD. To control for this heterogeneity, creativity, and inhibition were investigated in 
the predominantly inattentive (ADHD-I) and combined (ADHD-C) presentations. 
Method: Participants were males/females aged 18 to 51, diagnosed with ADHD-I 
(n=21), ADHD-C (n=19), or without ADHD (n=43). Self-rated Kaufman Domains of 
Creativity Scale and evaluator-rated figural Torrance Test of Creative Thinking 
(TTCT) were used for measuring creativity, Stroop task for inhibition, and Conners' 
Adult ADHD Rating Scales for ADHD symptoms. Results: The ADHD-C group 
reported higher self-rated creativity than other groups and made more original drawings 
paired to more abstract titles in the figural TTCT than controls. Conclusion: ADHD-C 
participants were the most creative. This result was more importantly associated with 
higher degrees of ADHD symptoms rather than poorer inhibition.

Introduction

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a childhood onset affecting 2.58% of the 
global adult population (Song et al., 2021). It leads to higher rates of failure to graduate 
high school, a higher likelihood to be unemployed, and makes developing and 
maintaining relationships difficult (Biederman et al., 2006). On the bright side, authors 
have wondered if ADHD is also associated with a strength: enhanced creativity 
(Hoogman et al., 2020).

Although this is disputed (Westmeyer, 1998), most studies that will be cited in the 
present work refer to creativity as the ability to generate ideas that are both novel and 
useful (Amabile, 2018; Cohen, 2011). Children with ADHD were initially suspected to 
possess superior creativity in the 1980s because their features (impulsive, distractible, 
and disorganized) echoed those of creative individuals (adventurous, nonconforming, 
and impulsive; Levine & Melmed, 1982; Torrance, 1988). Conversely, creative people 
present certain characteristics associated with ADHD. In samples of creative children 
and adolescents, 26% to 40% displayed clinically elevated symptoms of ADHD 
(Cramond, 1994; Healey & Rucklidge, 2006). Apart from similarities between these two 
populations, ADHD-like behaviors and symptoms are thought to contribute positively to 
creativity.

For instance, mind wandering would be beneficial to creativity in a problem-
solving task by creating opportunities to develop ("incubate") ideas (Baird et 
al., 2012). Moreover, an impulsive personality may help to generate more 
new ideas (Brem & Utikal, 2019) and, in employees, impulsive behaviors 
could predict creative ideas (Gozukara, 2016).

Taken altogether, these pieces of evidence lead to believe that the ADHD population 
could be highly creative. To verify this, two particular dimensions of the 4P framework 
of creativity were investigated: the “Person” (i.e., what defines a creative person in 
terms of personality traits, temperament, behaviors, etc.) and the “Process” (i.e., the 
psychological factors involved in creativity; Rhodes, 1961). In other words, investigators 
were especially interested in verifying whether individuals with ADHD presented as 
creative-looking beings or if they were prone to creative thinking. The Person 
dimension of creativity is mostly assessed with self-rated scales measuring 
achievements and behaviors considered creative (e.g., publishing a book) or the self-
perception of creative abilities (Kaufman, 2012; Silvia et al., 2012). The Process 
dimension of creativity is usually evaluated with time-constrained experiments that aim 
to measure the psychological operations supporting the creative process. Most tasks 
are measuring divergent thinking (DT) and/or convergent thinking (CT), two 
concepts introduced by Joy Paul Guilford in its Structure of Intellect theory (Guilford, 
1967). DT is the ability to generate many spontaneous and novel ideas. A DT task may 
require finding new uses for an object (e.g., a brick can be used as a paperweight). 
Performance is then rated on at least some of the criteria reflecting the different 
components of DT: fluency (number of ideas), originality (rarity of the ideas), flexibility 
(variety of ideas), and elaboration (expansion from an idea). CT stands in opposition to 

DT. It is often comprehended as the ability to find the most appropriate solution to a 
problem (Guilford, 1967), but is also coined as the fusion of ideas (Lubart, 2016). In a 
CT task, examinees may be presented with three words (e.g., right-cat-carbon) and 
asked to find a fourth one that associates them all (e.g., "copy"; Mednick, 1962), for 
instance. Both DT and CT can be used alternatively throughout the creative process 
(Lubart, 2016). As an example, a marketing team could brainstorm about the different 
ways they can advertise a product before narrowing down and refining their best idea. 
Likewise, a DT task may partly solicit a meta control state associated with CT and vice-
versa (Zhang et al., 2020). Thus, it is more adequate to comprehend creative thinking 
tasks as tools measuring, in various importance, both DT and CT rather than tasks 
assessing exclusively either one of these two processes.

A recent literature review by Hoogman et al. (2020) breaks down the findings of 23 
behavioral studies on creativity in children and adults with an official diagnosis of 
ADHD. It reveals that three of the four studies using creativity scales reported higher 
self-rated creativity in adults with ADHD compared to controls, more precisely in terms 
of creative achievements. Results from DT tasks studies are more conflicting. Out of 14 
clinical case-control studies on ADHD (9 in children, 5 in adults), two studies in children 
and three in adults found that participants with ADHD performed significantly better, 
especially in terms of originality. However, out of the five case-control studies 
presenting results from CT tasks, three within the children population found no 
differences between groups, and the other two, respectively in children and adults, 
found worst performances in the ADHD groups. Thus, when ADHD groups 
outperformed control groups, it tended to be in terms of self-reported creativity and DT 
rather than CT. This tendency could be shaped by executive inhibition abilities.

Executive inhibition (or cognitive inhibition), as defined by Barkley (2005), is the ability
to inhibit a prepotent response and control interference. Fragilized inhibitory processes 
may hinder performances to CT tasks, which require inhibiting intrusions to stay focused
until the right answer is found (Fiore et al., 2001; Howard-Jones & Murray, 2003). 
Executive inhibition functioning may also have an incidence on DT abilities, but this 
relation is not as straightforward. Some findings support the idea that better executive 
inhibition is associated with higher creativity, especially in terms of DT abilities 
(Benedek et al., 2012, 2014; Edl et al., 2014). Executive inhibition would help 
suppress prepotent ideas in favor of original ideas. Interestingly, other findings show 
that poorer executive inhibition may also be advantageous to DT. In adults without 
ADHD, poorer performance to a reading inhibition task is associated with higher idea 
generation to a DT task (Fiore et al., 2001). Carson et al. (2003) also discovered that 
lower latent inhibition could contribute to DT by facilitating associations between 
ideas. Latent inhibition is a concept closely related to interference control in executive
inhibition. It refers to the capacity to filter out familiar stimuli from the environment in 
profit of new stimuli (Lubow, 1989). Lower latent inhibition is also associated with 
more creative achievements (Carson et al., 2003).

The case-control study in adults with ADHD of White and Shah (2006), which is part of 
the systematic review of Hoogman et al. (2020), revealed that participants with ADHD 
performed worst to a CT task and better to a DT task than participants without ADHD. 

Executive inhibition, sometimes impaired in ADHD (Nigg, 2001), was measured by a 
proactive interference task and appeared to mediate CT, but not DT. As the authors 
explained, executive inhibition is not a unitary concept and ADHD is associated with 
multiple inhibitory deficits, so other ADHD-related inhibitory deficits might better 
contribute to DT. For instance, the implication of response inhibition on creativity 
(Barkley, 1999) has yet to be investigated within this population. Thus, particularities 
related to executive inhibition may explain some of the variability of the results 
between CT, DT, and creative behaviors within the ADHD population. Still, judging by 
the review of Hoogman et al. (2020), there also appears to be considerable variability 
between the behavioral studies that used the same type of tasks. This may be 
attributable to the heterogeneity of the ADHD samples.

The most prevalent presentations of ADHD are combined (ADHD-C) and predominantly
inattentive (ADHD-I; American Psychiatric Association (APA, 2013). However, previous 
work on creativity overlooked this subdivision of the disorder or only considered the 
combined presentation. This is an issue since reviews have shown that individuals with 
ADHD-I and ADHD-C may perform differently to standard measures of inhibition like the
cued Go/No-go task (Adams et al., 2008) and the Stroop task (van Mourik et al., 2005),
suggesting the existence of specific response inhibition alterations for these two 
presentations of ADHD. Besides, only a portion of those who suffer from ADHD present
significant impairments (Nigg et al., 2005). Considering the shreds of evidence 
supporting a hypothetical role of executive inhibition functioning in creativity, 
variations of inhibition fragilities between and within presentations of ADHD may 
contribute to the variability of the results observed by Hoogman et al. (2020).

As just mentioned, ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder in terms of behavioral symptoms
(Wåhlstedt et al., 2009) and certain seem to be more beneficial to creativity than others.
In children, teacher-rated impulsive/hyperactive symptoms were related to higher 
fluency but low inattention was related to better flexibility (Brandau et al., 2007). In 
adults, self-reported ADHD symptoms (especially impulsivity and hyperactivity) were 
positively correlated to DT and the number of creative achievements and behaviors in 
self-rated questionnaires (Boot et al., 2017b). Thus, impulsivity and hyperactivity seem 
to be the main drivers of superior self-rated creativity and creative thinking in contrast to
inattention, especially in DT. These symptoms are found in different importance across 
the presentations of ADHD (APA, 2013), meaning DT abilities and self-rated creativity 
may vary between these presentations.

Thus, the first objective of this study was to explore creativity as measured by self-
report scales and DT tasks in the two most prevalent presentations of ADHD in adults: 
ADHD-I and ADHD-C (Vitola et al., 2017), in comparison with adults who do not have 
ADHD. We predicted that adults with ADHD would rate their creativity higher than 
adults without ADHD and present a superior performance in a DT task. We also 
predicted that ADHD-I and ADHD-C would differ in these regards since they present 
different symptoms and possibly varying inhibition fragilities. Adults with ADHD-C may 
be more creative than adults with ADHD-I since they present more symptoms positively 
related to higher creativity. Our second objective was to examine whether self-reported 
creativity and DT were related to ADHD symptoms and executive inhibition, more 

specifically response inhibition, expecting that superior creativity would be associated 
with higher levels of ADHD symptoms and poorer executive inhibition.

Aside from the behavioral and cognitive heterogeneity observed in ADHD, some 
methodological inconsistencies could also account for the variability of the results found 
in the literature on creativity in ADHD. Medication for ADHD is not consistently 
controlled, despite evidence that psychostimulants may interact with creativity (Ten et 
al., 2020; although see Hoogman et al., 2020). Creativity may also be shaped by certain
sociodemographic variables. Castillo-Vergara et al. (2018) found that, in fifth-grade 
students, creative potential increased with social-economic status, and girls exhibited 
higher creativity than boys in terms of fluency, flexibility, and originality. Thus, we 
controlled for medication and these sociodemographic variables to the best of our 
capabilities.

Methods and Materials

Participants

Eighty-three participants from the region of Montreal, male (n=20) and female (n=63), 
within the age of 18 to 51 (mean [M]=26.66, standard deviation [SD]=8.73), took part in 
the study. The control group counted 43 participants and the clinical groups were 
composed of participants who had an official diagnosis of ADHD given by a licensed 
psychiatrist, physician, neuropsychologist, or psychologist. Twenty-one participants 
were diagnosed with ADHD-I and 19 were diagnosed with ADHD-C. Demographic data 
of our groups are presented in Table 1. Participants were required not to take their 
medication for ADHD during test day. Those treated with non-stimulant molecules (e.g., 
Atomoxetine) were not recruited since their therapeutic effects persist beyond their 
direct pharmacologic effects (Stahl & Grady, 2017). Other neurodevelopmental 
disorders such as language disorders, motor disorders, autism spectrum disorder, 
Tourette syndrome, or those who presented with neurological disorders and moderate 
or severe traumatic brain injuries also constituted exclusion criteria. However, people 
with specific learning disorders or anxiety and mood disorders were allowed to 
participate since these are highly comorbid with ADHD (DuPaul et al., 2013; Katzman et
al., 2017). Thus, five participants (control group: n=1, ADHD-C group: n=4) reported 
having dyslexia. Three participants of the ADHD-C group reported having an anxiety or 
mood disorder. Our results were not affected by the inclusion of these participants. 
Finally, a portion of the testing was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three 
participants from the ADHD-I group and one from the ADHD-C group were assessed by
teleconference. Again, our results were not affected by their inclusion.

Procedure

Participants were recruited with ads posted on Facebook and emails sent to students 
from colleges with whom we had a partnership. Confirmation of eligibility and consent 
were obtained through a form online. During 2-hour sessions, participants had to 
complete a self-report creativity scale to measure their perception of their creativity, a 
formal task of creativity to assess creative abilities, a response inhibition task to 
measure executive inhibition, and a self-report ADHD questionnaire to measure 

ADHD symptoms. A nonverbal reasoning task was also administered to verify if 
differences found between the groups in DT task could not be better explained by 
differences in nonverbal intelligence. Evaluations were conducted by either one of the 
four trained investigators under the supervision of an accredited neuropsychologist. 
Tests were always administered in the same order and were corrected by two scorers 
who were blind to the group and demographic data.

Measures

Self-reported creativity. The Kaufman Domains of Creativity Scale (K-DOCS) is a 
50 items questionnaire assessing self-perceived creative abilities (Kaufman, 2012). 
Examinees are asked to rate on a scale from 1 to 5 ("much less creative" to "much more
creative”) how creative they are compared to their peers. Five domains are evaluated: 
Self/Everyday (e.g., "Finding something fun to do when I have no money"), Scholarly 
(e.g., "Debating a controversial topic from my own perspective"), Performance (e.g., 
"Shooting a fun video to air on YouTube”), Mechanical/Scientific (e.g., "Solving math 
puzzles”), and Artistic (e.g., “Making a sculpture or piece of pottery"). For these 
domains, Kaufman (2012) reports internal consistency coefficients of.86,.86,.87,.86, 
and.83 respectively, as well as two weeks test-retest reliability of .80, .76, .86, 78, 
and .81. Raw total scores for each domain were used for analysis.

DT Task. The figural Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT); (Torrance, 2008) 
are three timed drawing activities requiring the production of recognizable images telling
a story from different basic stimuli (e.g., a “Y” shape). Images have to be as different as 
possible from the ones anyone else could do. The main scoring measures are Fluency, 
Originality, Elaboration, Abstractness of Titles, and Resistance to Premature Closure. 
Their definitions, as presented in the most recent version of the technical manual 
(Torrance, 2008), can be found in Table 2. The figural TTCT is reliable and valid (Kim, 
2011). Raw scores of each measure were used for analysis.

Executive inhibition. The Stroop Color and Word Task (Stroop Task); (Stroop, 
1935) is most often coined as a prepotent response inhibition task (Macleod, 2007). The
first three conditions were administered: color naming, word reading, and color-word 
reading. After naming the colors of a grid of squares that are either blue, green, or red 
and reading a grid of words that are either "Blue,” “Green," or "Red," examinees are 
presented with a grid of mismatched words and ink color (e.g., the word "Blue" is printed
in red). They have to perform a less automated task (naming ink color) while inhibiting 
automated responses (reading words). Those three conditions of the Color-Word 
Interference Test from the Delis–Kaplan Executive Functioning System (Delis et al., 
2001) were administered, but only the total number of errors and completion time of the 
color-word reading condition were retained for our analysis. Scaled scores were used to
compare groups on executive inhibition and raw scores were used for our main 
analyses. This subtest presents test-retest reliability of .62 to .76.

ADHD symptoms. The self-report version of Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales 
(CAARS); (Conners et al., 1999) is a 4 points Likert-type scale of ADHD symptoms 
measuring inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity symptoms. It has a test-retest 

reliability of .80 (Conners et al., 1999). T scores were used to compare groups on 
symptoms and raw scores were used for our main analyses.

Nonverbal intelligence. The Matrix Reasoning subtest of the Wechsler Adult 
Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV); (Wechsler, 2008) is a sequence of 
untimed visual puzzles requiring the use of logical and analogical reasoning correlating 
strongly with the perceptual reasoning index of the WAIS-IV (Wechsler, 2008). Scaled 
scores were used for verifying group equivalence of nonverbal abilities.

Data Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26). In our first 
objective, groups were compared on K-DOCS domains and measures of the figural 
TTCT (Fluency, Originality, Elaboration, Abstractness of Titles, and Resistance to 
Premature Closure) with one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). For our second 
objective, bilateral Pearson's correlations were used to evaluate if creativity scores in 
figural TTCT or K-DOCS were related to completion time and the number of errors in 
the color-word condition of the Stroop Task additionally to the CAARS symptom 
scales. To limit the number of analyses, correlations were only conducted in groups and
in measures where significantly higher creativity scores were found priorly in the results 
of Objective 1.

Results

Preliminary Analyses

Scores were distributed normally in all groups. Homogeneity of variances (p>.05) was 
confirmed by Levene's test. Tuckey's correction was used to control for the number of 
comparisons and the criterion for statistical significance was set at p<.05. As indicated 
by one-way ANOVAS, groups were equivalent on age (F[2,80]=3.047, p=.053, η²=.071) 
and estimated non-verbal intelligence (F[2, 80]=0.062, p=.940, n²=.002; Control group: 
M=11.62, SD=2.58; ADHD-I group: M=11.38, SD=3.20 ; ADHD-C: M=11.42, SD=2.32). 
Chi-squared test showed that groups were equivalent on sex, X² (2,N=83)=2.799. 
p=.247, V=0.184, and academic level, X² (2, N=83)= 3.385, p=.184. V=0.202.

Interrater reliability. The scoring of the figural TTCT is partly subjective, so interclass 
correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to estimate interrater reliability of its 
measures on a subset of 20 randomly chosen copies rated at different time points by 
our two scorers. ICCs estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated 
with two-way random-effect models based on single ratings and absolute agreement. 
According to the guidelines of Landis and Koch (1977), the ICCs of Fluency, Originality, 
Elaboration, and Resistance to Premature Closure were almost perfect being 
respectively 0.96 (0.91–0.99), 0.92 (0.81–0.97), 0.90 (0.77-0.96), and 0.92 (0.81-0.97). 
The ICC of Abstractness of Titles was moderate being 0.60 (0.21-0.82). Overall, 
interrater reliability was adequate.

ADHD symptoms and executive inhibition. To verify if the clinical groups presented 
the ADHD symptoms corresponding to their specific ADHD presentations (APA, 2013) 
additionally to poorer executive inhibition than controls (Nigg, 2001; Nigg et al., 2005),

groups were compared on CAARS and Stroop Task with one-way ANOVAs. There 
were significant effects of groups on the T scores of every CAARS scale (see Table 3). 
As expected, the pairwise analysis shows that both ADHD groups had a significantly 
higher Inattention score than the control group (see Table 4). The ADHD-C group also 
had significantly higher Hyperactivity and Impulsivity scores compared to other groups. 
To the Stroop Task, there was a large and significant effect of groups on the scaled 
scores for completion time and number of errors. ADHD-I and ADHD-C participants 
were significantly slower than controls (see Table 3). Participants with ADHD-I also 
made more errors than controls (see Table 4).

Objective 1

One-way ANOVAs revealed a large and significant effect of groups on the K-DOCS 
Performance domain, as presented in Table 5. Pairwise analysis, shown in Table 6, 
indicated that the ADHD-C group presented a significantly higher score than both the 
control and ADHD-I groups on the Performance domain. Other comparisons were not 
significant. On the figural TTCT, one-way ANOVAS showed significant and large effects
of groups in Originality and Abstractness of Titles (Table 5). Pairwise analysis revealed 
that only participants with ADHD-C displayed a significantly higher score than the 
controls for these measures (Table 6). No other significant differences were found 
between groups.

Objective 2

Bilateral Pearson's correlations presented in Table 7 showed that the total raw score for 
the hyperactivity scale of the CAARS was moderately positively correlated to the score 
in the performance domain of the K-DOCS in participants with ADHD-C. No significant 
correlation was found between figural TTCT measures and CAARS scales or Stroop 
Task's measures.

Discussion

In this study we investigated creativity in adults with or without ADHD, our main 
contribution being to explicitly distinguish between two ADHD presentations (ADHD-I 
and ADHD-C). We also verified if superior creativity between groups was related to 
higher ADHD symptoms and lower executive inhibition. Our results provide evidence 
that creativity varies between ADHD presentations, and we propose it might be mainly 
explained by differences in behavioral symptoms.

Our first finding was that participants with ADHD-C self-rated their creativity 
higher than the other groups on the K-DOCS, more precisely on the 
Performance domain, which encompassed music, theater, and dance.

Boot et al. (2017a) also found higher self-rated creativity scores in adults with ADHD 
compared to controls in the Performance domain, but also in the Mechanical/Scientific 
domain. This disparity either stands from a lack of statistical power on our behalf or 
differences between our clinical samples, as the authors did not control for ADHD 
presentations (Boot et al., 2017a). Regarding other creativity scales, higher self-rated 

creativity in adults with ADHD was also found in case-control studies that measured the 
number of real-world creative achievements (Boot et al., 2017a; DuPaul et al., 2017; 
White & Shah, 2011), but the different domains of creativity were not considered.

The score in the Performance domain of the ADHD-C group was moderately and 
positively related to hyperactivity and marginally, but not significantly, related to 
impulsivity (r=.420, p=.074). Interestingly, these symptoms are linked to extraversion 
(Krieger et al., 2020), a personality trait found in high levels in singers, comedians, and 
actors (Cameron et al., 2015; Greengross & Miller, 2009; Nettle, 2006). Extraversion 
would ease performers into taking the center stage, among other things. Thus, 
hyperactivity and impulsivity could, similarly to extraversion, make individuals with 
ADHD-C feeling comfortable and possibly even motivated to do acts related to the 
performance domain. To our knowledge, the present research was the first to examine 
the relation between the different symptoms of ADHD and self-rated creativity within a 
clinical sample. However, a study in adults without ADHD revealed that more self-
reported impulsivity and hyperactivity symptoms were correlated to more creative 
achievements, but again, in unspecified domains (Boot et al., 2017b). Therefore, there 
seems to be a link between self-reported hyperactivity and impulsivity and self-rated 
creativity, but its specificity to certain domains needs to be further studied. Moreover, 
since these domains often encompass heterogenous subdomains of creativity (e.g., the 
Performance domain in K-DOCS covers acts of writing and playing music instruments), 
an item analysis would help to identify more precisely the kind of activities in which 
individuals with ADHD feel they are particularly creative.

Our second important and novel finding was that participants with ADHD-C 
also produced more original drawings paired to more abstract titles, but only 
compared to the controls.

This is in line with the tendency to detect higher originality scores in adult participants 
with ADHD compared to controls in a variety of DT measures, as reported in the 
systematic review of Hoogman et al. (2020). With regards to Abstractness of Titles, 
Fugate et al. (2013) have observed the same outcome in gifted children with ADHD 
compared to their peers without the disorder.

More self-reported hyperactive and impulsive symptoms were not linearly associated 
with better performances to the DT task in participants with ADHD-C, contrarily to the 
findings of other studies in participants without ADHD (Boot et al., 2017b; Brandau et 
al., 2007). In ADHD, this relation may be rather curvilinear. Up to a certain point, more 
ADHD symptoms could be associated with more cognitive impairments, which 
ultimately lowers DT performances, similarly to schizotypy symptoms and DT (Acar & 
Sen, 2013). While Boot et al. (2017b) did not found such a curvilinear relation and did 
not found more cognitive deficits in participants self-reporting more ADHD symptoms, 
the number of participants with clinically elevated symptoms of ADHD within their 
sample (17%) was likely overestimated if compared to the prevalence of ADHD in the 
general population (2.58%; Song et al., 2021). A clinical sample of participants officially 
diagnosed with ADHD may offer a better representation of the gradient of cognitive 

deficits associated with higher levels of ADHD symptoms. Interestingly, there was a 
moderate and positive, but not significant, relationship between the Originality score and
the number of self-reported inattentive symptoms ( r=.416, p=.076). Perhaps, curvilinear
analyses would be more adequate for measuring the relation between the behavioral 
symptoms of ADHD and creativity.

The ADHD-I group was not creatively superior to the other groups. This is coherent with
previous works suggesting that the main drivers of ADHD are hyperactivity/impulsivity 
(Boot et al., 2017b; Brandau et al., 2007), two symptoms self-reported in smaller 
importance in ADHD-I. Nonetheless, mind wandering (an inattention-like behavior) 
should enhance creativity in DT (Baird et al., 2012), but this typically implies an 
incubation period that occurs while taking a break from the task at hand. Moreover, in 
adults without ADHD, a more flexible attention allowing rapid changes in modes of 
focus is associated with higher performances to DT tasks, which requires quick 
transitions between ideas (Zabelina et al., 2016). Conversely, a “leaky” attention that 
would not properly filter out irrelevant information, which shares more likeness to the 
attentional profile found in ADHD, has been associated with more creative 
achievements, but not DT. Thus, the qualities of the DT task chosen, a timed-
constrained activity that did not allow pauses for mind wandering and that may have 
benefited from a flexible attention rather than inattentiveness could have been 
disadvantageous for participants with ADHD-I.

Finally, there is little evidence in our results supporting our hypothesis that higher DT 
scores would be related to poorer executive inhibition. In ADHD-C, poorer executive 
inhibition was marginally and positively, but not significantly, related to a higher score 
in the Performance domain (r=.390, p=.099), which echoes the findings of Carson et al. 
(2003) who reported higher self-rated creativity in adults with poorer latent inhibition. 
Executive inhibition appeared to be most impacted in participants with ADHD-I, 
compared to controls. Yet, these groups were not creatively different. Thus, our results 
do not strongly support either hypothesis of a positive contribution of higher and poorer 
executive inhibition to creativity. They are rather in line with other works that found no 
clear association between these two concepts (Burch et al., 2006; Green & Williams, 
1999; Stavridou & Furnham, 1996). It is worth noting that prepotent response inhibition 
is only a facet of response inhibition, and more largely of inhibition functioning. This has 
only been little studied in ADHD, so further investigation is needed to determine if 
poorer executive inhibition has any positive implications on creativity in this 
population.

An important limitation of this study was the sample size. Because our recruitment was 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to obtain the sample size 
initially planned for our clinical groups. More statistical power could confirm (or 
disconfirm) the tendencies we underlined. We particularly had difficulties recruiting male
participants, especially in our clinical groups. Moreover, our groups were also almost 
nonequivalent regarding age. Fortunately, most studies report no gender-based 
differences in creativity (Abraham, 2016). While aging has been shown to fragilize 
inhibitory mechanisms and consequently, facilitate DT, this has been observed in a 

much older sample (aged 60-77; Carpenter et al., 2020). Thus, it is unlikely that these 
variables had a significant effect on our results.

Conclusion

At the time of writing, this was the first study that compared creativity between clinical 
samples of individuals officially diagnosed with ADHD-I and ADHD-C. Taken together, 
our results suggest there are variations of creativity between these two presentations, 
with higher creativity scores exclusively being found in ADHD-C. These higher scores 
appeared to be linked more importantly to behavioral symptoms than poorer executive 
inhibition. Our results are novel and have several important implications for future 
research on ADHD and creativity. They highlight the importance of considering the 
presentations of ADHD in research on creativity. ADHD presentations are associated 
with different sets of behavioral symptoms, and some appear to contribute better than 
others to certain facets of creativity. This is not to say individuals with ADHD-I are not 
highly creative. The domain or in which they exude creativity might simply be unknown 
yet. Moreover, if mind-wandering and inattentiveness are the entryways of creativity in 
ADHD-I, time-constrained tasks may not be the best suited for measuring this ability in 
this population. Future work should recognize the heterogeneity of ADHD but also aim 
to refine the identification of the domains and the contexts in which individuals with 
different presentations of ADHD may excel creatively. It will then be possible to better 
orient this group toward success.
