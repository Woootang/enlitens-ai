DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a research article by Rumball, Happé, and Grey (2020) exploring the 
experience of trauma and the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in autistic adults. The 
study finds that autistic individuals are at a heightened risk of developing PTSD from a 
broader range of life events than typically recognized. Crucially, it shows that both 
standard DSM-5 Criterion A traumas and non-DSM-5 traumas (like bullying or 
bereavement) can act as catalysts for probable PTSD, with over 40% of the sample 
showing symptoms. The paper argues for a wider definition of trauma in clinical practice
for autistic individuals to ensure they receive appropriate diagnosis and care.

Experience of Trauma and PTSD Symptoms in Autistic 
Adults: Risk of PTSD Development Following DSM-5 and 
Non-DSM-5 Traumatic Life Events

Freya Rumball, Francesca Happé, and Nick Grey

Lay Summary

This study explored the experience of trauma and rates of probable post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults with autistic spectrum disorder 
(ASD). We asked 59 autistic adults to complete online questionnaires about 
their experiences of stressful or traumatic events and related mental health 
difficulties. Autistic adults experienced a wide range of life events as 
traumatic, with over 40% showing probable PTSD within the last month and 
over 60% reporting probable PTSD at some point in their lifetime. Many of 
the life events experienced as traumas would not be recognized in some 
current diagnostic systems, raising concerns that autistic people may not 
receive the help they need for likely PTSD.

Introduction

Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) are known to be at increased risk of
experiencing adverse life events, such as peer victimization and maltreatment. Co-
occurring mental health difficulties are common, and it has been posited that core 
features of ASD may also confer heightened risk of post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD).

According to DSM-5 criteria, PTSD is only diagnosable following exposure to actual or 
threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (Criterion A). However, the 
definition of "trauma" has been widely debated, and a range of non-Criterion A events 
have been reported to trigger PTSD symptoms, such as cumulative stress from bullying.
It has been suggested that for individuals with ASD, a broader or different range of life 
experiences may be interpreted as traumatic and act as a catalyst for PTSD-like 
symptoms. This study aims to explore what events are interpreted as traumatic by 
adults with ASD and the rates of probable PTSD following both DSM-5 and non-DSM-5
traumas.

Methods

Fifty-nine adults with a diagnosis of ASD who had experienced an event they found 
traumatic completed online questionnaires. Trauma exposure was measured using the 
Life Events Checklist (LEC-5) for DSM-5 events, and a series of open-ended 
questions for non-DSM-5 traumas. PTSD symptomatology was assessed using the 
PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) for both current and lifetime symptoms.

Results

Traumatic Life Events

● DSM-5 Traumatic Life Events: 33 participants reported a traumatic life event 

meeting DSM-5 Criterion A. The most commonly reported traumas were sexual 
and physical abuse.

● Non-DSM-5 Traumatic Life Events: 35 participants reported a traumatic event 
that did not meet DSM-5 Criterion A. The most commonly reported non-DSM-5 
traumas included bullying, bereavement, and traumas relating to mental health
problems such as anorexia and "breakdowns." Other reported events included 
the ASD diagnostic process itself, abandonment, and stress from social 
difficulties.

Probable PTSD Rates

● Following DSM-5 Trauma: The rate of probable current PTSD was 45%. The 

rate of lifetime probable PTSD was 61%.

● Following non-DSM-5 Trauma: The rate of probable current PTSD was 43%. 

The rate of lifetime probable PTSD was 63%.

● Across the total sample: The rate of probable current PTSD following any 

trauma was 47%, and the lifetime rate was 64%.

Discussion

Adults with ASD reported a broad range of life events as traumatic. The rate of probable
PTSD in our ASD participants following DSM-5 or non-DSM-5 traumas was similar, 
ranging from 43% to 45%. This is far higher than rates previously reported in trauma-
exposed general-population studies.

Interestingly a similar proportion of individuals experienced PTSD symptoms
after non-DSM-5 traumas that would not meet DSM-5 PTSD Criterion A. 
This finding... highlights the importance of the individual's subjective 
response to and interpretation of an event when defining "trauma".

The study suggests that the more subjective definition of trauma in the ICD-11 ("an 
extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events") may be better suited for 
diagnosing PTSD in the ASD population compared to the more restrictive DSM-5 
criteria.

The elevated rates of probable PTSD for ASD adults may be explained by a number of 
cognitive, behavioral, and neurological risk pathways. Cognitive models of PTSD 
highlight pre-trauma vulnerability factors that are often features of ASD, such as detail 
focus ("weak-central coherence"), difficulties with social interaction, and emotion 
dysregulation.

Clinical Implications

General population research has shown that PTSD can go undetected if 
individuals are not asked about the occurrence of specific traumas. In 
individuals with ASD, for whom socio-communicative difficulties are a 
cardinal feature, trauma assessment should ideally include self-report via 
standardized trauma checklists and clinical interviews, as well as gathering 
of information from different sources and informants.

Worryingly, recent statistics suggest that only 10% of ASD providers in the United 
States routinely screen for trauma-related symptoms. The present findings suggest that 
clinicians should be ready to consider a wide range of experiences as traumatic and 
concentrate on the subjective experience of ASD adults.

...where symptoms meet criteria for PTSD with re-experiencing of trauma 
memories occurring, withholding a diagnosis based on DSM-5 Criterion A 
risks denying much needed support and treatment.

Conclusions

Adults with ASD described a wide range of life events as being experienced as 
traumatic. Findings indicate that adults with ASD may be at increased risk of PTSD 
development following both traumas meeting DSM-5 PTSD Criterion A and non-DSM-
5 traumatic events that do not meet Criterion A. Clinical services for adults with ASD 
would benefit from routine screening for trauma exposure and assessing PTSD 

symptomatology in trauma-exposed individuals, allowing for current evidence-based 
treatments to be delivered to this potentially at-risk population.
