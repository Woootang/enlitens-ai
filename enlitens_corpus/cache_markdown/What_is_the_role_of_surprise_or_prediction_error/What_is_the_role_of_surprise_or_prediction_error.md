Surprise and Prediction Error in Capturing Attention and Enhancing Memory: A
Comprehensive Review

1. Introduction

Surprise and prediction error—defined as the mismatch between expected and actual outcomes—play a pivotal

role in how attention is allocated and how memories are formed and updated. Across cognitive neuroscience,

psychology, and learning theory, a robust body of research demonstrates that surprising events and prediction

errors can enhance attention to relevant stimuli and promote the encoding, updating, and consolidation of

memories (Rouhani & Niv, 2021; Sinclair & Barense, 2019; Sinclair et al., 2020; Kalbe & Schwabe, 2020; Lee et al.,

2006; Jang et al., 2019; Antony et al., 2023; Smout et al., 2019; Sinclair & Barense, 2018; Shing et al., 2023; Ortiz-

Tudela et al., 2023; Pupillo et al., 2023; Kennedy et al., 2024; Fernández et al., 2016; Nolden et al., 2024; Holland &

Schiffino, 2016; Rouhani et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2020; Bein et al., 2023; Antony et al., 2020; Brod et al., 2022;

Greve et al., 2017; Wills et al., 2007; Rouhani et al., 2023; Bein et al., 2021; Kafkas & Montaldi, 2018; Brod, 2021;

Wahlheim et al., 2021; Sinclair et al., 2020; Jang et al., 2018; Nasser et al., 2017; Quent et al., 2021). These effects

are observed in both reward-based and aversive contexts, across the lifespan, and in both laboratory and real-

world settings. However, the relationship is nuanced: the magnitude, timing, and context of prediction errors, as

well as individual and developmental differences, can modulate whether surprise enhances or impairs memory and

attention (Nolden et al., 2025; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2023; Pupillo et al., 2023; Liedtke et al., 2025; Decker et al., 2020;

Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2021; Csink et al., 2021; Turan et al., 2024; Torrents-Rodas et al., 2023). This review synthesizes

current evidence on the mechanisms by which surprise and prediction error influence attention and memory,
highlighting key findings, boundary conditions, and open questions.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search strategy involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8 thematic

clusters, focusing on prediction error, surprise, attention, memory encoding, and related neural mechanisms. In
total, 1,041 papers were identified, 807 were screened, 560 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant

papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Mechanisms: How Surprise and Prediction Error Capture Attention

Surprise and prediction error act as signals that direct attention to unexpected or behaviorally relevant stimuli.
Neural and behavioral studies show that prediction errors, often signaled by midbrain dopamine neurons, increase

the salience of cues and enhance attentional processing (Lee et al., 2006; Smout et al., 2019; Holland & Schiffino,

2016; Holland & Gallagher, 2006; Wills et al., 2007; Iordanova et al., 2021; Nasser et al., 2017). This attentional boost
is critical for learning, as it prioritizes the processing of information that deviates from expectations (Smout et al.,

2019; Holland & Schiffino, 2016; Wills et al., 2007; Brod, 2021; Nasser et al., 2017).

3.2. Memory Enhancement: Encoding, Updating, and Reconsolidation

Prediction errors not only capture attention but also facilitate memory encoding and updating. Surprising events

are more likely to be encoded into memory, and prediction errors can trigger the reconsolidation and updating of
existing memories (Rouhani & Niv, 2021; Sinclair & Barense, 2019; Sinclair et al., 2020; Kalbe & Schwabe, 2020;

Jang et al., 2019; Sinclair & Barense, 2018; Shing et al., 2023; Fernández et al., 2016; Nolden et al., 2024; Rouhani et

al., 2017; Frank et al., 2020; Bein et al., 2023; Antony et al., 2020; Brod et al., 2022; Greve et al., 2017; Rouhani et al.,
2023; Bein et al., 2021; Kafkas & Montaldi, 2018; Wahlheim et al., 2021; Sinclair et al., 2020; Jang et al., 2018; Quent

et al., 2021). Both signed (directional) and unsigned (magnitude) prediction errors have been shown to enhance

memory, with effects mediated by dopaminergic and noradrenergic modulation of the hippocampus and related

structures (Rouhani & Niv, 2021; Jang et al., 2019; Rouhani et al., 2023; Iordanova et al., 2021; Jang et al., 2018;
Nasser et al., 2017).

3.3. Boundary Conditions and Moderators

The relationship between prediction error and memory is not always linear. Some studies report an inverted U-

shaped or context-dependent effect, where intermediate levels of prediction error maximize memory, while very
high or low levels may impair it (Nolden et al., 2025; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2023; Pupillo et al., 2023; Liedtke et al.,

2025; Decker et al., 2020; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2021; Csink et al., 2021; Turan et al., 2024; Torrents-Rodas et al.,

2023). The timing of prediction error relative to encoding, the type of memory (item vs. associative), and individual
factors such as age and cognitive state also moderate these effects (Nolden et al., 2025; Shing et al., 2023; Ortiz-

Tudela et al., 2023; Pupillo et al., 2023; Liedtke et al., 2025; Decker et al., 2020; Gruber & Fandakova, 2021; Ortiz-

Tudela et al., 2021; Csink et al., 2021; Turan et al., 2024; Torrents-Rodas et al., 2023).

3.4. Real-World and Developmental Perspectives

Surprise and prediction error enhance memory not only in controlled experiments but also in real-world settings,

such as autobiographical memory for surprising events (Antony et al., 2023; Antony et al., 2020; Antony et al.,
2023). Developmental studies suggest that the effects of surprise on memory may change across the lifespan, with

some evidence for reduced or even negative effects in children and older adults (Nolden et al., 2025; Shing et al.,

2023; Gruber & Fandakova, 2021; Csink et al., 2021). The neural circuits underlying these effects continue to mature
through adolescence (Gruber & Fandakova, 2021).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports the view that surprise and prediction error are central to the allocation of attention

and the enhancement of memory encoding and updating (Rouhani & Niv, 2021; Sinclair et al., 2020; Jang et al.,
2019; Smout et al., 2019; Sinclair & Barense, 2018; Shing et al., 2023; Holland & Schiffino, 2016; Rouhani et al., 2017;

Frank et al., 2020; Bein et al., 2023; Antony et al., 2020; Brod et al., 2022; Greve et al., 2017; Wills et al., 2007;

Rouhani et al., 2023; Bein et al., 2021; Kafkas & Montaldi, 2018; Brod, 2021; Wahlheim et al., 2021; Sinclair et al.,

2020; Jang et al., 2018; Nasser et al., 2017; Quent et al., 2021). These effects are mediated by neuromodulatory

systems (dopamine, noradrenaline) and involve dynamic changes in hippocampal and cortical representations

(Sinclair et al., 2020; Jang et al., 2019; Smout et al., 2019; Rouhani et al., 2023; Iordanova et al., 2021; Nasser et al.,

2017). However, the relationship is complex: the magnitude, timing, and context of prediction errors, as well as
individual and developmental differences, can modulate whether surprise enhances or impairs memory and

attention (Nolden et al., 2025; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2023; Pupillo et al., 2023; Liedtke et al., 2025; Decker et al., 2020;

Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2021; Csink et al., 2021; Turan et al., 2024; Torrents-Rodas et al., 2023).

Some studies highlight boundary conditions, such as the possibility of inverted U-shaped effects or the need for

strong prior expectations to observe memory benefits from prediction errors (Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2023; Pupillo et

al., 2023; Bein et al., 2021; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2021; Quent et al., 2021). There is also evidence that surprise can

sometimes impair memory, particularly in children or under high arousal (Nolden et al., 2025; Decker et al., 2020;

Csink et al., 2021). The type of memory (item vs. associative, familiarity vs. recollection) and the explicitness of

predictions also play a role (Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2023; Pupillo et al., 2023; Brod et al., 2022; Bein et al., 2021; Kafkas
& Montaldi, 2018; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2021; Turan et al., 2024; Quent et al., 2021).

5. Conclusion

Surprise and prediction error are powerful drivers of attention and memory, enhancing the encoding and updating

of information when expectations are violated. These effects are mediated by neuromodulatory systems and

dynamic neural processes, but are subject to important boundary conditions and individual differences.

Understanding these mechanisms has implications for education, clinical interventions, and real-world learning.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite substantial progress, gaps remain in understanding the precise boundary conditions, developmental

trajectories, and real-world applications of prediction error effects on attention and memory. More research is

needed on the role of explicit vs. implicit predictions, the impact of different types of novelty, and interventions to
harness these mechanisms in educational and clinical settings.
