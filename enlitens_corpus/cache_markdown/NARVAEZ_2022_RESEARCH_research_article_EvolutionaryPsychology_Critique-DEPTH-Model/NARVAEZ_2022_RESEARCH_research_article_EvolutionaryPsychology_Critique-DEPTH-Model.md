DOCUMENT SUMMARY This paper provides a powerful critique of the dominant school of 
evolutionary psychology, referred to as "Narrow Evolutionary Psychology" (NEP), arguing that 
its foundations in outdated neo-Darwinian and computationalist theories are flawed. The authors
propose an alternative, the Developmental Evolutionary Psychology Theory (DEPTH), which 
integrates modern biology, developmental science, epigenetics, and anthropology. DEPTH 
emphasizes human plasticity and the "Evolved Developmental Niche" (EDN)—the species-
typical care practices required for healthy development—to establish more appropriate 
baselines for human nature, directly challenging NEP's deterministic and often pathologizing 
assumptions.

Evolving Evolutionary Psychology

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is a foundational text for the Enlitens mission, as it provides a comprehensive, 
scholarly dismantling of the deterministic, gene-centric evolutionary psychology that has often 
been used to justify pathologizing views of human nature. It offers a scientifically robust and 
ethically aligned alternative—Developmental Evolutionary Psychology Theory (DEPTH)—that 
resonates perfectly with our core principles.

The paper’s emphasis on epigenetics, developmental plasticity, and the Evolved 
Developmental Niche (EDN) provides the scientific language for what we do: understanding 
that every brain makes perfect sense for the life it's lived. The EDN—which includes practices 
like responsive care, extensive touch, and breastfeeding—gives us a species-typical baseline 
for healthy development, allowing us to frame neurodivergent traits and mental health struggles 
not as inherent defects, but as adaptations to an environment that has failed to provide these 
essential developmental inputs. This paper gives us the theoretical framework to "free people 
from the disempowering belief in biological determinism".

Critical Statistics for Our Work

● Humanity's Deep History: Civilization represents no more than 1% of the existence of 
the genus Homo. Industrialized societies represent a still smaller fraction of that 1%. 
Humans lived in small-band hunter-gatherer societies for over 1.9 million years.

● Human Immaturity at Birth: Human neonates are particularly immature, resembling 

fetuses of other primates until 18 months of age, requiring an "external womb" 
(exterogestation).

● Genetic Similarity: 99.9% of the human genome is common to all people.
● Rise in Childhood Adversity: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are on the rise in

the United States, leading to illness and early death.

Methodology We Can Learn From

● Transdisciplinary Integration: The proposed DEPTH model is built on integrating 
knowledge from multiple fields, including evolutionary developmental biology, 
epigenetics, developmental neuroscience, anthropology, and cognitive archeology. This 
is a blueprint for the holistic, integrative approach Enlitens champions.

● Rethinking Baselines: The paper argues for a critical re-evaluation of what constitutes 

a "normal" baseline for human nature. It challenges the use of WEIRD (Western, 
Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) populations as the default, arguing 
instead for baselines derived from EDN-consistent societies (e.g., small-band hunter-
gatherers) which better reflect our species' deep history.

● Focus on Niche Provision: The authors shift the focus from a simple inheritance of 

genes to the inheritance of a developmental niche. The "Evolved Developmental Niche 
(EDN)" provides the necessary context and resources for healthy neurobiological and 
psychological development. This is a powerful framework for assessment.

Findings That Challenge the System

● Critique of "Narrow Evolutionary Psychology" (NEP):

○ NEP is built on outdated science: It relies on neo-Darwinian adaptationism and a 
"mind-as-computer" computationalist view, both of which are now subject to 
"serious, mainstream debate and fundamental revision" within their home 
disciplines.

○ NEP is genetically deterministic: Despite claims to the contrary, NEP promotes a 
view where genes are a "relatively fixed" internal source of information and the 
environment is a "relatively variable" external trigger, a separation that is 
"indefensible in light of contemporary biological theories and data".

○ NEP Ignores Development: NEP's focus on "ultimate" (ancestral) causes allows it
to "effectively sidestep the role of development," a position that is untenable 
given that development is a direct cause of evolutionary change.

● The Power of Plasticity and Epigenetics:

○ Human brains are remarkably plastic. Early experiences, facilitated by our 

extended immaturity, "contribute to shaping the brain and its functions for the 
long term".

○ Gene expression is regulated by experience via epigenetics. Influences include 

"hormones, diets, parenting, and influences from the broader social 
environment". We inherit far more than genes.

● "Normal" is Not What We Think:

○ Characteristics often assumed by NEP to be universal human nature (e.g., 

selfishness, aggression, specific mate selection criteria) are based on studies of 
EDN-inconsistent, industrialized populations.

○ In contrast, individuals raised in EDN-consistent contexts (like nomadic foragers) 
demonstrate characteristics such as "intuitive cooperation and generosity, high 
autonomy with high communalism, and with no coercion and little competition".

Populations Discussed

● The paper critiques research that overwhelmingly relies on WEIRD (Western, Educated, 
Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) samples to make universal claims about human 
nature.

● It advocates for studying populations that are more representative of humanity's deep 
history, such as small-band hunter-gatherer societies, to establish more accurate 
developmental baselines.

Alternative Approaches Mentioned

● Developmental Evolutionary Psychology Theory (DEPTH): This is the central 

alternative proposed. It is an integrative framework that emphasizes:

○ Multiple Inheritances: We inherit genes, but also cell structures, culture, 

ecology, and a developmental niche.

○ Developmental Systems: Humans are dynamic, complex systems that self-

organize in response to their experiences.

○ Plasticity & Epigenetics: Our biology is profoundly shaped by our environment, 

especially in early life.

● The Evolved Developmental Niche (EDN): This is a key concept within DEPTH. It 
refers to the set of ancestral caregiving practices that are necessary for optimal 
neurobiological and psychological development. The EDN includes:

○ Soothing perinatal experiences.
○ Extended on-request breastfeeding.
○ Constant affectionate touch and responsiveness to needs.
○ Multiple responsive caregivers (allomothers).
○ Self-directed play with multi-aged peers.

● 4E Cognition: As an alternative to NEP's "mind-as-computer" model, the authors point 
to the rise of 4E (Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive) cognition, which 
grounds cognition in the real-time, practical engagement of an organism with its world.

Quotes We Might Use

● On Challenging Determinism: "In contrast to the most prominent evolutionary 

psychology theory that emphasizes the stranglehold of humanity's evolutionary past, a 
developmental evolutionary psychology theory orients to dynamic development in the 
present, taking epigenetics and plasticity seriously".

● On the Importance of Experience: "Every individual constructs their personhood 
through real-time engagement with the world, so it matters what kind of relational 
experiences the individual has".

● On the Flaws of NEP: "...the significant revolutions taking place today in both 

evolutionary biology and cognitive science reveal NEP to be rooted in the orthodoxies of 
the past".

● On What We Inherit: "We inherit much more than genes. Biology, environment, and 
culture are seamlessly intertwined, in both individual development and evolution".
● On Redefining Human Nature: "It may be time to rethink using individuals with an 

EDN-inconsistent childhood as prototypical specimens for gathering information on the 
human species generally".

● On a New Research Direction: "Rather than puzzling about altruism, the question 

would be what sorts of evolutionary and developmental processes explain why there is 
little or no concern about 'altruism' in deeply cooperative societies...".

Clinical Implications

● Assessment Must Include Developmental Context: A client's psychological 

presentation cannot be understood without assessing their developmental history, 
specifically the presence or absence of the Evolved Developmental Niche (EDN) 
components. A lack of these components can be understood as a form of developmental
trauma.

● Shift from Pathology to Adaptation: Difficulties like stress reactivity, social anxiety, 
and aggression can be reframed as logical neurobiological outcomes of an EDN-
inconsistent upbringing, rather than as inherent disorders.

● Focus on Prevention and Restoration: Understanding the EDN provides a clear 

roadmap for prevention (supporting new parents to provide this care) and intervention 
(creating therapeutic environments that provide the missing relational experiences to 
help clients build healthier neurobiological regulation).

● Challenge Fatalism: The DEPTH model empowers clients by rejecting the notion of a 
fixed, genetically-determined "human nature." It emphasizes plasticity and the potential 
for change and healing at any point in life by providing the right relational and 
environmental supports.
