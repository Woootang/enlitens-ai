Yes, endogenous opioids—especially the mu-opioid system—mediate the positive
feelings of social connection and agreement after being persuaded, by reinforcing
social bonding, affiliative behaviors, and the pleasurable aspects of social consensus.

1. Introduction

Endogenous opioids, particularly those acting on mu-opioid receptors (MORs), play a central role in the neurobiology
of social connection and the positive affect associated with agreement and social bonding. The "brain opioid theory of
social attachment" posits that the same neurochemical systems underlying physical pleasure and pain relief also
mediate the rewarding feelings of social connection, trust, and group belonging (Løseth et al., 2024; Charles et al.,
2020; Inagaki et al., 2016; Inagaki, 2018; Løseth et al., 2014; Soares et al., 2025; Lang et al., 2017; Inagaki et al., 2020).
Human and animal studies show that blocking the mu-opioid system reduces feelings of social connectedness, while
social activities that foster bonding—such as laughter, touch, and synchronized movement—trigger endogenous
opioid release and increase positive affect (Løseth et al., 2024; Charles et al., 2020; Manninen et al., 2017; Pellissier et
al., 2018; Inagaki et al., 2016; Lang et al., 2017; Inagaki et al., 2020; Tarr et al., 2015; Tarr et al., 2016). These effects are
especially pronounced in contexts involving social agreement, rituals, or persuasive communication, where shared
beliefs and behaviors are reinforced by opioid-mediated pleasure and reduced social pain (Charles et al., 2020;
Manninen et al., 2017; Løseth et al., 2014; Lang et al., 2017; Inagaki et al., 2020). The opioid system interacts with other

neuromodulators (e.g., oxytocin, dopamine) but appears to have a unique and primary role in the affective "glue" of

social connection (Charles et al., 2020; Inagaki, 2018; Putnam & Chang, 2022; , 2017; Borland, 2025). This review

synthesizes evidence on how endogenous opioids relate to the positive feelings of social connection and agreement

after persuasion.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across more than 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search targeted endogenous opioids, social connection, positive

affect, and agreement after persuasion. In total, 1,013 papers were identified, 588 were screened, 277 were deemed

eligible, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Mu-Opioid System and Social Bonding

Meta-analyses and experimental studies show that blocking the mu-opioid system (e.g., with naltrexone) modestly but

consistently reduces feelings of social connectedness and bonding in humans (Løseth et al., 2024; Charles et al., 2020;

Inagaki et al., 2016; Inagaki et al., 2020). This effect is observed in both laboratory and real-world settings, and is

especially pronounced in established relationships and group rituals (Løseth et al., 2024; Charles et al., 2020; Inagaki

et al., 2016; Inagaki et al., 2020).

3.2. Endogenous Opioid Release and Positive Social Activities

Social laughter, touch, and synchronized activities (e.g., dance, rituals) trigger endogenous opioid release, as measured

by PET imaging and pain threshold proxies, and are associated with increased positive affect and social closeness
(Manninen et al., 2017; Pellissier et al., 2018; Lang et al., 2017; Tarr et al., 2015; Tarr et al., 2016). The degree of opioid
release predicts the strength of social bonds and the pleasurable feelings of connection (Manninen et al., 2017;
Pellissier et al., 2018; Lang et al., 2017; Tarr et al., 2015; Tarr et al., 2016).

3.3. Opioid System and Agreement/Consensus

The opioid system reinforces the positive affect associated with social agreement and consensus, making shared
beliefs and persuasive messages more rewarding (Charles et al., 2020; Løseth et al., 2014; Lang et al., 2017; Inagaki et
al., 2020). Rituals and group activities that foster agreement are particularly effective at activating the opioid system
and enhancing group solidarity (Charles et al., 2020; Lang et al., 2017; Tarr et al., 2015).

2 / 8

3.4. Mechanisms and Interactions

Mu-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens and other reward-related brain regions mediate the hedonic value of

social connection and agreement (Pellissier et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2018; Løseth et al., 2014; Allain et al., 2022; Toddes
et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2015; Trezza et al., 2011). The opioid system interacts with dopamine and oxytocin, but appears
to be the primary mediator of the affective "reward" of social bonding and consensus (Charles et al., 2020; Inagaki,
2018; Putnam & Chang, 2022; , 2017; Borland, 2025).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports that endogenous opioids, especially via the mu-opioid system, mediate the positive
feelings of social connection and agreement after being persuaded. Blocking the mu-opioid system consistently

reduces feelings of social bonding and connection, while activities that foster social agreement and synchrony (e.g.,

rituals, laughter, touch) increase opioid release and positive affect (Løseth et al., 2024; Charles et al., 2020; Manninen
et al., 2017; Pellissier et al., 2018; Inagaki et al., 2016; Lang et al., 2017; Inagaki et al., 2020; Tarr et al., 2015; Tarr et al.,

2016). The opioid system appears to be the primary neurochemical pathway for the affective "reward" of social
bonding, with unique contributions beyond those of oxytocin or dopamine (Charles et al., 2020; Inagaki, 2018; Putnam

& Chang, 2022; , 2017; Borland, 2025). The effects are modest but robust, and may accumulate over time to support
long-term social bonds and group cohesion (Løseth et al., 2024; Charles et al., 2020; Løseth et al., 2014; Lang et al.,

2017; Inagaki et al., 2020). However, the opioid system is not the only player—other neuromodulators and contextual
factors (e.g., stress, relationship type) also shape the experience of social connection and agreement (Charles et al.,

2020; Inagaki, 2018; Putnam & Chang, 2022; , 2017; Borland, 2025). Limitations include the modest effect sizes,
reliance on pharmacological manipulations, and the need for more research on the specific role of opioids in

persuasion and belief change.

5. Conclusion

Endogenous opioids, especially via the mu-opioid system, are central to the positive feelings of social connection and

agreement after being persuaded. They reinforce social bonding, affiliative behaviors, and the pleasurable aspects of
social consensus, with unique contributions beyond other neuromodulators.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence, gaps remain in understanding the specific role of endogenous opioids in persuasion, belief
updating, and real-world social agreement, as well as their interactions with other neurochemical systems.
