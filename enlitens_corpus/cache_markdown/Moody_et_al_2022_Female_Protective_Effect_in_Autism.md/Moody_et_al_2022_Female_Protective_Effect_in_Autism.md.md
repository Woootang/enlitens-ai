DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This 2022 research article provides strong empirical evidence for the "female protective effect" 
(FPE) in autism, the theory that females require a greater genetic and etiological load to receive 
an autism diagnosis. By comparing autistic males with an autistic sister to those with only 
autistic brothers, the study found that males from female-containing families exhibit more severe
impairments in motor skills and adaptive functioning. Crucially, no difference was found in core 
social communication symptoms. This paper is core to Enlitens' mission as it scientifically 
validates the existence of a diagnostic bias against females, explains why their presentation 
may differ (potentially with fewer non-social impairments), and powerfully supports the need for 
more nuanced, individualized assessment methods beyond standardized tools calibrated to a 
male phenotype.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"The reduced prevalence of autism in females has been hypothesized to be a result of a female 
protective effect (FPE), wherein females require a greater etiological load—genetic and/or 
environmental—to be diagnosed with autism when compared to males."

"According to this model, if an autistic female is diagnosed, her family is likely to carry a greater 
etiological load for autism than families with only autistic males. Therefore, the FPE predicts that
the autistic siblings of autistic females should, on average, present with more severe autistic 
traits."

"Here, we tested this central hypothesis of the FPE by comparing the severity of autistic traits in 
a large, well-characterized cohort of 609 autistic males with at least one autistic sister (from 

'female-containing' multiplex families) and 2038 autistic males with only autistic brothers (from 
'male-only' multiplex families)."

"Consistent with the FPE, we found that autistic males with an autistic sister demonstrated 
significantly more severe restricted and repetitive behaviors, and greater motor and adaptive 
skills deficits than autistic males with only autistic brothers."

"Notably, we did not find a significant difference in social communication deficits between the 
two groups of autistic males. Our findings suggest that the FPE may not uniformly impact all 
autistic traits, but rather may have a greater effect on non-social traits such as motor skills and 
adaptive behaviors."

"Our study provides strong evidence for the FPE in autism and suggests that the FPE has a 
greater impact on non-social autistic traits. These findings have important implications for both 
the diagnosis and underlying neurobiology of autism in females."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Study Population: The study analyzed data from two large repositories: the Simons 
Simplex Collection (SSC) and the Simons Powering Autism Research for Knowledge 
(SPARK) database.

● Sample Size: The final sample consisted of 2,647 autistic males from multiplex families 

(families with more than one autistic child).

○ 609 autistic males were from "female-containing" (FC) multiplex families (i.e., had

at least one autistic sister).

○ 2,038 autistic males were from "male-only" (MO) multiplex families (i.e., had only 

autistic brothers).

● Primary Finding: Autistic males from FC families had significantly more severe 
impairments in non-social domains compared to autistic males from MO families.

○ Motor Skills: On the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-II), males from 
FC families had significantly lower (more impaired) scores in Motor Skills (p = 
0.005).

○ Adaptive Behavior: Males from FC families also had significantly lower scores 

on the VABS-II Adaptive Behavior Composite (p = 0.045).

● No Difference in Social Communication: There was no significant difference 
between the two groups of males on measures of social communication deficits, 
including the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) Total Score (p = 0.17) and the 
ADOS-2 Social Affect score (p = 0.53).

● Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs): Autistic males from FC families showed 
significantly more severe RRBs as measured by the ADOS-2 Restricted and Repetitive 
Behavior score (p = 0.038).

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Female Protective Effect (FPE)

The central framework of the paper, which posits that biological females are inherently more 
resistant to the etiological factors that cause autism.

● Definition: "The reduced prevalence of autism in females has been hypothesized to be 
a result of a female protective effect (FPE), wherein females require a greater etiological 
load—genetic and/or environmental—to be diagnosed with autism when compared to 
males".

● Mechanism: The biological mechanisms are unknown but are theorized to be a 

combination of genetic, hormonal, and immunological factors that buffer females against 
developing an autistic phenotype at a lower etiological load.

Liability-Threshold Model

This is the statistical and conceptual model that underlies the FPE.

● Concept: It assumes that there is an underlying, continuous "liability" for autism in the 

population, which is composed of all relevant genetic and environmental risk factors. An 
individual is diagnosed with autism only when their liability crosses a certain diagnostic 
"threshold".

● FPE within the Model: The FPE proposes that the diagnostic threshold is higher for 
females than for males. Consequently, a female must accumulate a greater liability 
(more risk factors) to cross this higher threshold and be diagnosed.

● Prediction for Families: "A key prediction of this model is that if a female is diagnosed 
with autism, her family must carry a greater liability for autism than families with only 
male autistics. It therefore follows that the autistic siblings of autistic females should 
present with more severe autistic traits than the autistic siblings of autistic males". This 
study was designed to directly test this prediction.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

Participant Selection

Participants were drawn from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) and SPARK databases. The
study focused on autistic males from two types of multiplex families:

● Female-Containing (FC) Multiplex Families: Families with at least one diagnosed 

autistic daughter and at least one diagnosed autistic son. The autistic sons from these 
families formed the FC male group.

● Male-Only (MO) Multiplex Families: Families with at least two diagnosed autistic sons 
and no diagnosed autistic daughters. The autistic sons from these families formed the 
MO male group.

Measures Used

A range of standardized instruments were used to quantify autistic traits, cognitive ability, and 
adaptive functioning.

● Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2): A semi-
structured, standardized assessment of social affect (SA), restricted and repetitive 
behaviors (RRB), and other behaviors associated with autism. The Calibrated Severity 
Score (CSS) was used for comparison.

● Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2): A quantitative measure of 

autistic social impairment, completed by a parent/caregiver.

● Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R): A parent-report questionnaire measuring

the presence and severity of repetitive behaviors.

● Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II): A parent-report 

measure assessing adaptive functioning in three domains: Communication, Daily Living 
Skills, and Socialization. It also provides an Adaptive Behavior Composite score. An 
optional Motor Skills domain is included for younger children.

● Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ): Assessed using various standardized IQ tests 
appropriate for the participant's age and verbal ability (e.g., Wechsler scales, Differential 
Ability Scales-II, Mullen Scales of Early Learning).

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Implications for Diagnosis of Females

The study's findings have significant implications for clinical practice and the diagnosis of autism
in females.

● Diagnostic Bias: The results provide strong evidence for a diagnostic bias. Since 

females require a greater etiological load to be diagnosed, the current diagnostic criteria,
heavily based on male presentations, are likely missing females who have a lower load 
but still meet the threshold for being autistic.

● Rethinking Core Symptoms: The finding that the FPE has a greater impact on non-
social domains (motor skills, adaptive functioning) than on social communication is 
crucial. "Our findings suggest that autistic females who receive a diagnosis may present 
with more severe non-social deficits, and that females with less severe non-social 
deficits may be missed by current diagnostic practices". This challenges the simplistic 
notion that females are missed only because they are "better at masking" social 
difficulties. It suggests clinicians should be aware that an autistic girl or woman may 
present with significant social challenges but relatively intact motor and adaptive skills, 
and this presentation should not rule out a diagnosis.

● Need for New Assessment Tools: The study highlights the inadequacy of current 
assessment tools that may not be sensitive to the female phenotype of autism. This 
reinforces the need for more nuanced, qualitative, and individualized assessment 
methods, like the Enlitens Interview, that can look beyond a checklist of behaviors 
calibrated on male-only or male-majority samples.
