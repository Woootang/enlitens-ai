# Extracted Text for Lerner_2018_RESEARCH_handbook_chapter_ASD_Assessment_Critique_History.md.pdf

DOCUMENT SUMMARY This 2018 chapter from the APA Handbook of Psychopathology is a 
powerful resource, providing a mainstream academic overview of Autism Spectrum Disorder 
(ASD) assessment that is filled with critical admissions. It details the unstable history of the 
diagnostic criteria, including a stunning 60% false positive rate for the DSM-III-R in some cases,
and explicitly discusses the gender and cultural biases that lead to under-detection. While 
describing the ADOS/ADI-R as the "gold standard," it also reviews the known psychometric 
weaknesses of many other commonly used standardized questionnaires, reinforcing the need 
for a more nuanced approach.

AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This handbook chapter is an essential piece of evidence because it comes from the heart of the 
establishment (the American Psychological Association) and validates nearly every critique we 
have of the traditional assessment model. It provides a detailed history of the arbitrary and 
unstable nature of the DSM criteria for autism, including a shocking statistic about the high rate 
of false positives in a past edition. The authors openly discuss the "gold standard" while also 
cataloging the known flaws and biases (gender, cultural) of standardized tools. The chapter's 
discussion of "diagnostic overshadowing" and the concept of "the autisms" directly supports our 
neurodiversity-affirming, whole-person approach. We can use this chapter as a foundational 
document to show that our revolutionary stance is not just an opinion, but a necessary evolution
based on the acknowledged weaknesses of the current system.

The Shifting Sands of Diagnosis: A History of the DSM

The chapter provides a history of the diagnostic criteria for autism, demonstrating its instability 
over time.

● DSM-III (1980): Officially recognized autism as a unique disorder called "infantile 
autism," placing it in a new class of "pervasive developmental disorders" (PDDs).
● DSM-III-R (1987): Renamed the condition "autistic disorder" and adopted a polythetic 

approach requiring 8 of 16 criteria to be met.

● CRITICAL FLAW: An international field trial revealed that the DSM-III-R criteria 

resulted in a high rate of false positive cases. In cases with a co-occurring intellectual
disability, the
 false positive rate was about 60%.

● DSM-IV: Aligned more closely with the ICD-10 and introduced other PDDs, including 
Asperger's disorder. However, the diagnostic validity of these subtypes was later 
challenged.

● DSM-5 (2013): Transformed the PDD umbrella into a single "Autism Spectrum Disorder"
(ASD) category, collapsing the previous triad of impairments into two domains (social-
communication and RRBs).

● Ongoing Instability: The chapter notes that the DSM-5 criteria may be less likely to 

identify young children, women, and those with normative IQs who were diagnosed 
under DSM-IV. In response to this concern, the DSM-5 included a "grandfather clause" 
stating that anyone with a previous DSM-IV PDD diagnosis should retain a DSM-5 ASD 
diagnosis.

A Critical Review of "Evidence-Based" Assessment Tools

The "Gold Standard" (ADOS & ADI-R)

● The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic 

Interview-Revised (ADI-R) have become the "sine qua non of assessment in research—
and, increasingly, clinical—settings".

● The ADOS is a semi-structured, play-based evaluation administered directly to the 
individual, which has transformed ASD from one of the least reliably diagnosed 
childhood disorders to one that is now assessed reliably.

● The ADI-R is a semi-structured parent interview focusing on current and historical 

symptoms.

● Crucial Caveat: The authors note that even with these gold standard tools, the 

complexities of clinical cases "often necessitate the augmentation of these diagnoses by 
clinical expert evaluation according to DSM-5 criteria, as well as chart review".

Commonly Used (and Flawed) Questionnaires

The chapter mentions several other common tools and their psychometric weaknesses:

● Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2): Often used as an outcome 

measure, but there are "questions about divergent validity".

● Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS): Easy for parents to complete, but "tends to have

relatively low specificity in clinical settings".

● Autism Quotient (AQ): A self-report instrument that is highly face-valid but "sometimes 

shows poorer convergence with other ASD measures".

Systemic Biases in Assessment

Gender Bias

● Girls with ASD may be "more likely to go undetected because of subtler presentation of 

symptoms".

● Core features can differ by gender; boys' perseverative interests may be on clearly 
atypical topics (e.g., a 14-year-old interested in Thomas the Train), while girls may 

perseverate on more normative topics (e.g., dolls, the social hierarchy of their school), 
making their interests less obvious as a "symptom".

● These presentation differences may impact early detection efforts in girls.

Cultural Bias

● Cultural variations can impact symptom expression and detection.
● The chapter uses eye contact as a key example: it is a normative social behavior in 

many Western cultures but less so in some Eastern cultures.

● Because many autistic people show an aversion to direct eye contact, these "ASD-

related behaviors may not be as immediately detected (or even viewed as atypical) in 
cultures where eye contact is generally rare".

● The authors conclude that "It is worthwhile to consider cultural context when evaluating 

individuals for potential ASD".

Key Concepts for Our Work

● "The Autisms": The chapter validates the concept of neurodiversity by stating that the 
ASD category encompasses "a myriad of largely as-yet-unspecified genetically and 
environmentally determined conditions and syndromes that are sometimes called 'the 
autisms'".

● Diagnostic Overshadowing: The text defines this practice as symptoms that are non-

core to ASD being "subsumed under the ASD diagnosis". The authors note that there is 
now "exponentially greater appreciation for the existence of comorbidity and the clinical 
importance of its recognition".

The Search for Biomarkers (The System's "Impossible Dream")

The chapter discusses the future of assessment, highlighting the field's search for "functional 
biomarkers" to provide more objective measures.

● The stated goals for these biomarkers include:

○ Applicability across a wide range of functioning and development.
○ Being scalable and cheap for clinical use.
○ Sensitivity to subtle neural changes, not just observable behavior.
○ Objectivity that does not require clinician reliability training.

● Current research in electrophysiology and eye-tracking shows "great promise" in 

meeting these goals.
