DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This review article by Mottron et al. proposes the "enhanced plasticity hypothesis" to explain the
significant male-to-female sex ratio bias in autism. The authors argue that males have a lower 
threshold for a "plastic reaction" in perceptual brain regions following a genetic or environmental
trigger, making them more susceptible to developing an autistic neurotype. The paper provides 
extensive evidence from genetics, brain imaging, and animal models to support the concept of a
"female protective effect," where females require a greater genetic load to be diagnosed. This 
framework is crucial for Enlitens as it offers a scientific, non-pathologizing explanation for why 
autistic females are often missed by standard diagnostics and why their presentation may differ 
from males, validating the need for more nuanced, individualized assessment methods like the 
Enlitens Interview.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"Boys have a 4 to 7 higher-fold risk of developing autism than girls."

"The 'protective effect' observed in females with respect to the autism spectrum (AS) remains 
largely unexplained."

"We focus on sex differences in plasticity at the synaptic and regional level and hypothesize that
these differences influence the threshold for the development of plastic reactions in specific 
brain areas involved in perception and language."

"Autism involves cognitive hyper-functioning and cortical reallocations , which have not yet been
mechanistically related to sex."

"The sex ratio bias in autism may arise because males have a lower threshold than females for 
the development of this plastic reaction following a genetic or environmental event."

"A study of more than 9,000 dizygotic twins from population-based cohorts showed that siblings 
of autistic females exhibit significantly more autistic traits than siblings of autistic males , 
suggesting that female patients carry a higher 'genetic load' than male patients."

"The AS sex ratio cannot be explained by a genetic mechanism resulting from severe loss of 
function mutations found in AS individuals with a low IQ, but rather by factors present in AS 
individuals without ID, in whom severe loss of function mutations have not been found and SIS 
and PP are consistently reported."

"Sexual divergence of developmental trajectories also suggests that the plastic reaction 
happens in different regions in boys and girls, resulting in a different autistic phenotype in men 
and women. This explains why males and females may be diagnosed according to different 
symptoms and/or using different weights attributed to the three diagnostic areas."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Sex Ratio: Boys have a 4 to 7 times higher risk of developing autism than girls.
● Prevalence of Talents: In one study of 254 autistic individuals, the prevalence of 

special isolated skills (SIS) was 62.5%. In a smaller group from the same study, the 
prevalence of perceptual peaks (PP) was 58%, compared to 13% in controls.

● Genetic Load in Females:

○ Siblings of autistic females show significantly more autistic traits than siblings of 

autistic males, suggesting females carry a higher "genetic load".

○ Studies show that de novo copy number variants (CNVs) are more common in 

autistic females than males and disrupt more genes in females.

○ In a large CNV analysis, autistic females were twice as likely to have exonic 

deletions involving FMRP targets than autistic males.

○ In an independent cohort of 762 families, females had three times more 
deleterious autosomal CNVs and many more unique deleterious single-
nucleotide variants (SNV) than males. The effect of these SNVs was also 
substantially more severe in autistic females.

● RRBI Differences: A meta-analysis concluded that while males and females had similar 
communication and social symptoms, girls showed fewer repetitive, restricted behaviors 
and interests (RRBI) than boys.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Enhanced Plasticity Hypothesis This paper's central hypothesis proposes that the sex 
ratio bias in autism stems from differences in brain plasticity.

● Core Tenet: Males have a lower threshold than females for developing an "enhanced 
plastic reaction" in response to a genetic or environmental event. This plastic reaction 
targets specific brain areas, particularly those involved in perception and language, 
leading to the development of an autistic cognitive style.

● Mechanism: Interactions between genetic sex and hormones may result in higher 

synaptic and regional plasticity in perceptual brain areas in males compared to females. 
This increased plasticity makes them more susceptible to the cortical reallocations that 
characterize autism.

● Contrast with Extreme Male Brain (EMB) Theory: While the EMB theory attributes the
sex ratio to autism being an "extreme" form of the typical male brain, the enhanced 
plasticity hypothesis focuses on the dynamic process of brain development and 
reorganization. It accounts for genetic findings not related to hormones and provides a 
mechanism for how different phenotypes can emerge in males and females.

Trigger-Threshold-Target (TTT) Model This model, introduced in a previous paper by the 
authors and applied here, links genetics, plasticity, and the cognitive profile of autism.

● Trigger: Genetic mutations (e.g., in genes related to synaptic function) or environmental 

insults act as the trigger.

● Threshold: Individuals have a certain threshold for initiating a plastic reaction. This 

threshold is hypothesized to be lower in males than in females. Similar mutations can 
lead to different phenotypes depending on this threshold.

● Target: The plastic reaction targets the most variable and plastic brain regions, which 
are often the sexually dimorphic perceptual and multimodal association cortices. This 
reallocation of brain resources leads to the pattern of cognitive strengths (e.g., 
Enhanced Perceptual Functioning) and challenges seen in autism.

Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) and Regional Plasticity The paper builds on the 
EPF model by connecting it to observable brain changes.

● Regional Plasticity (Cortical Reallocation): This is defined as the "experience-

dependent dedication of a cerebral region to a cognitive function that does not typically 
map to this region in the general population".

● EPF as a Result of Plasticity: The EPF model posits that autistic cognitive strengths 
(like superior perceptual performance) result from strong encoding mechanisms, 
enhanced perceptual expertise, and a greater role for perception in overall cognition. 
The TTT model proposes that this is the direct result of an enhanced plastic reaction 
targeting perceptual brain regions.

● Evidence: Autistic individuals show higher activity in temporal, occipital, and parietal 
regions during visual tasks , and these areas of enhancement overlap with regions 
known to be highly variable and sexually dimorphic in the general population.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

The Female Protective Effect and Phenotype The paper provides a comprehensive biological
explanation for why females are diagnosed with autism less frequently and may present 
differently.

● Higher Mutational Burden: Multiple large-scale genetic studies confirm that autistic 

females carry a significantly higher "genetic load" than autistic males. This includes more
frequent and more severe
 de novo CNVs and SNVs. This suggests that females are protected and require a more 
significant genetic event to develop a recognizable autistic phenotype.

● Different Phenotypes: The model predicts that because the plastic reaction targets 
different brain regions in males and females (due to baseline sex differences in 
development), the resulting autistic phenotype will also differ.

● RRBI Differences: The most consistently reported phenotypic difference is that autistic 

girls show fewer repetitive, restricted behaviors and interests (RRBI) than boys.

● Compensatory Strategies: The observation that phenotypic differences are most often 
reported in adolescents and adults with typical intelligence suggests that "compensatory 
social communication strategies develop over time, especially in girls". This can mask 
the underlying neurotype and lead to missed or late diagnoses.

● High-IQ vs. Low-IQ Autism: The sex ratio imbalance is strongest in high-functioning 

autism. Autistic females and males with low IQ have a similarly high incidence of severe,
likely gene-disruptive mutations. In contrast, such mutations are rare in high-functioning 
autistic males, suggesting the sex bias is driven by factors present in individuals without 
intellectual disability.
