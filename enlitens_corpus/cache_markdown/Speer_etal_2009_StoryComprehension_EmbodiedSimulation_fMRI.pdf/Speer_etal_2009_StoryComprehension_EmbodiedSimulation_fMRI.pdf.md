DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This fMRI study provides powerful evidence that reading a story is an act of embodied 
simulation, not abstract symbol processing. The researchers found that as people read a 
continuous narrative, different parts of their brains—those involved in real-world action, 
perception, and interaction—become active when the story's content changes. For example, 
reading about a character manipulating an object activates motor cortex areas for grasping, and
reading about spatial changes activates brain regions for navigation, confirming that readers 
understand a story by simulating the events in the story world.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"These results support the view that readers understand a story by simulating the events in the 
story world and updating their simulation when features of that world change."

"The information available to readers when reading a story is vastly richer than the information 
provided by the text alone."

"Recent theories of reading comprehension suggest that the representations of these various 
situation model dimensions are based on the activity of brain regions involved in analogous 
perceptions and actions in the real world (Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg, 1997; Zwaan, 2004)."

"These theories suggest that the same representations used for making or watching a goal kick 
are activated when reading about a goal kick."

"The brain regions involved in tracking different dimensions of a reader's situation model should 
correspond to regions that have a role in seeing and acting out similar activities in the real 
world."

"These results suggest that readers use perceptual and motor representations in the process of 
comprehending narrated activity, and these representations are dynamically updated at points 
where relevant aspects of the situation are changing."

"By contrast, the current paradigm used continuous reading of extended passages with no overt
judgment task."

"This convergence is consistent with the idea that readers construct simulations of situations as 
they read a text, and that this process is similar to those of recalling previous situations or 
imagining potential ones."

"Overall, these data make a strong case for embodied theories of language comprehension, in 
which readers' representations of situations described in language are constructed from basic 
sensory and motor representations (Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg, 1997; Zwaan, 2004)."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

The study's evidence consists of specific fMRI activations corresponding to changes in the 
story's content:

● Character and Goal Changes:

○ Changes in characters and their goals activated regions in the bilateral posterior 
superior temporal cortex (Brodmann's areas 22/39). These same regions are 
known to be active when observing goal-directed, intentional actions in the real 
world.

○ Goal changes also activated the prefrontal cortex (BA 9, 44, 46), an area where 

damage is known to impair knowledge of goal-directed activities.

● Object Interaction Changes:

○ When a character in the story interacted with an object (e.g., "Raymond laid 

down his pencil"), brain regions considered part of the human "grasping circuit" 
became active.

○ This included a region in the lateral precentral sulcus (BA 6) corresponding to the

premotor hand area, and a region in the postcentral cortex (BA 2/40) 
corresponding to the somatosensory hand representation and anterior 
intraparietal cortex. The activations were appropriately lateralized to the left 
hemisphere, consistent with right-handed action.

● Spatial Changes:

○ When characters changed their location in the story (e.g., "Raymond raced down 
the terrace"), there was activation in two bilateral superior frontal regions (BA 6). 
These locations are consistent with the functionally defined frontal eye fields 
(FEF), which are involved in controlling eye movements.

○ Changes in spatial location also activated the right and left parahippocampal 
cortex, a region known to be critical for processing changes in spatial location 
and navigation.
● Responses to Multiple Changes:

○ Brain regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal 

cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral hippocampi showed increased 
activation as the
 number of simultaneous changes in the story increased.

○ The anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32), a region involved in monitoring conflict, 

also increased activity with the number of changes, possibly serving as a cue for 
the reader to update their mental model of the story.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

Task and Stimuli

● Participants: 28 right-handed, native English speakers read stories while in an fMRI 

scanner.

● Stimuli: Participants read four short, naturalistic narratives describing the everyday 

activities of a seven-year-old boy. The stories were presented one word at a time on a 
screen to minimize eye movements.

● Coding: The researchers coded each clause of the narratives for changes along six 

different dimensions believed to be central to situation models:

1. Time: References to temporal information (e.g., "immediately").
2. Causality: When an event was not directly caused by a previous event.
3. Character: When the subject of the clause changed.
4. Space: When a character changed physical location.
5. Object: When a character interacted with an object in a new way (e.g., picking it 

up).

6. Goal: When a character initiated a new goal.

fMRI Analysis

● The study used a rapid event-related fMRI design, treating each clause as a trial.
● A general linear model (GLM) was used to identify brain regions where the BOLD signal 
significantly increased at the onset of clauses that contained a change in one of the six 
dimensions, compared to the baseline activity at the start of all clauses. This allowed the
researchers to isolate the brain's response to specific types of changing information 
within the continuous narrative.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Situation Models

The study is based on the theory of "situation models," which posits that readers understand a 
text by creating elaborate, multi-dimensional mental representations of the situation being 
described. These models are not just representations of the text itself, but integrate the reader's 
world knowledge with the text's information. The theory holds that readers maintain and update 
several dimensions, including characters, space, time, objects, and goals. Readers are thought 
to update their models when the incoming information has low overlap with the current model, 
such as when a character moves to a new location or starts a new goal. This study aimed to find
the neural correlates of this updating process.

Embodied or Grounded Cognition

The study directly tests and provides strong support for theories of embodied or grounded 
cognition. These theories propose that the mental representations used for understanding 
language are not abstract or amodal, but are "grounded" in the brain's sensory and motor 
systems. The core prediction is that understanding a story about an action (e.g., kicking a ball) 
involves reactivating the same neural representations used for actually performing or perceiving 
that action. The study's results—showing that changes in object interactions activate the brain's 
grasping circuit, and spatial changes activate navigation circuits—are presented as a powerful 
confirmation of this hypothesis in the context of continuous, naturalistic reading. The authors 
conclude that this may reflect a general principle where cognition is grounded in real-world 
sensory and motor experiences.
