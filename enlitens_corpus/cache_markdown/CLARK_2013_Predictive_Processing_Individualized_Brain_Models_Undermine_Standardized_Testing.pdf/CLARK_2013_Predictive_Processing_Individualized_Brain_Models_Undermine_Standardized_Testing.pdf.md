DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper, "Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive 
science," by Andy Clark, presents a comprehensive overview of the hierarchical predictive 
processing (PP) framework. It argues that the brain is not a passive feature-detector but an 
active "prediction machine" that constantly generates and updates a model of the world to 
predict sensory inputs. This model provides powerful scientific backing for Enlitens' mission by 
demonstrating that each brain develops a unique, experience-dependent generative model, 
directly supporting the idea that "every brain makes perfect sense for the life it's lived" and 
fundamentally challenging the validity of standardized, one-size-fits-all assessments.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of 
cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory 
inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical 
generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical 
processing."

"The task is not to find such a mapping but to infer the nature of the signal source (the world) 
from just the varying input signal itself."

"The beauty of the bidirectional hierarchical structure is that it allows the system to infer its own 
priors (the prior beliefs essential to the guessing routines) as it goes along. It does this by using 
its best current model-at one level - as the source of the priors for the level below, engaging in a

process of 'iterative estimation' ... that allows priors and models to co-evolve across multiple 
linked layers of processing so as to account for the sensory data."

"On this model, perception demands the success of some mutually supportive stack of states of 
a generative model (recall sect. 1.1 above) at minimizing prediction error by hypothesizing an 
interacting set of distal causes that predict, accommodate, and (thus) 'explain away' the driving 
sensory signal."

"neural signals are related less to a stimulus per se than to its congruence with internal goals 
and predictions, calculated on the basis of previous input to the system."

"To perceive the world just is to use what you know to explain away the sensory signal across 
multiple spatial and temporal scales."

"...different organisms amount (Friston https://www.google.com/search?q=2011a) to different 
'embodied models' of their specific needs and environmental niches, and their expectations and 
predictions are formed, encoded, weighted, and computed against such backdrops."

"Using a variety of tricks, tools, notations, practices, and media, we structure our physical and 
social worlds so as to make them friendlier for brains like ours."

"The combination of 'iterated cognitive niche construction' and profound neural permeability by 
the statistical structures of the training environment is both potent and self-fueling. When these 
two forces interact, repeatedly reconfigured agents are enabled to operate in repeatedly 
reconfigured worlds, and the human mind becomes a constantly moving target."

"A possible link emerges if perception and belief-formation, as the present story suggests, both 
involve the attempt to match unfolding sensory signals with top-down predictions."

"Delusion and hallucination then become entrenched, being both co-determined and co-
determining."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

FFA as Face-Expectation Region (Critique of Simple Feature Detection):

● A study by Egner et al. cite_start demonstrated that neurons in the fusiform face area 

(FFA) respond as strongly to non-face (house) stimuli when there is a high expectation 
of seeing faces as they do to actual face-stimuli.

● "FFA activity displayed an interaction of stimulus feature and expectation factors, where 
the differentiation between FFA responses to face and house stimuli decreased linearly 
with increasing levels of face expectation, with face and house evoked signals being 
indistinguishable under high face expectation."

● The study suggests that "[FFA] responses appear to be determined by feature 
expectation and surprise rather than by stimulus features per se" (Egner et al. 
https://www.google.com/search?q=2010, p. 16601).

● The authors concluded that the FFA might be better understood as a "face-expectation 
region" rather than a "face-detection region," a result that strongly favors a hierarchical 
predictive processing model over a simple feature-detection model.

Contextual Effects on Early Visual Processing:

● An fMRI study by Murray et al. cite_start found that as higher-level brain areas settled on

an interpretation of a visual shape, activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) was 
dampened, consistent with successful predictions "explaining away" the sensory data.
● Melloni et al. cite_start showed that the time required to form a conscious percept varied 
by around 100 msec depending on the presence of appropriate expectations, and that 
the EEG signatures of conscious perception varied accordingly.

● Summerfield et al. cite_start demonstrated that "repetition suppression" (reduced neural 

activity for repeated stimuli) is itself reduced when the repetition is unexpected, 
suggesting the effect is driven by predictability, not just repetition.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Hierarchical Predictive Processing

The core idea is that the brain is a hierarchical prediction machine. Perception and action are 
supported by the brain constantly trying to match incoming sensory information with top-down 
predictions or expectations. This process uses a "hierarchical generative model" that aims to 
minimize "prediction error" through a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing.

● Top-Down & Bottom-Up Flow: Higher-level systems in the brain's hierarchy attempt to 

predict the inputs to lower-level systems. The top-down connections carry the 
predictions themselves. The bottom-up (or forward) connections carry the "residual 
errors"—the difference between the prediction and the actual sensory signal. This 
residual error is what drives adaptation and learning in the higher-level models.

● Generative Models: A generative model's purpose is to capture the statistical structure 
of observed inputs by modeling the causal matrix responsible for that structure. A good 
generative model for vision, for instance, would capture how lower-level visual 
responses are generated by the interacting causes in a visual scene. The top-down 
connections in the hierarchy come to encode this probabilistic model.

Escaping the Black Box: The Brain's Unique Learning Model

The paper frames the brain's core task as discovering information about the causes of sensory 
signals without any direct access to the world itself. "For, the task of the brain, when viewed 
from a certain distance, can seem impossible: it must discover information about the likely 
causes of impinging signals without any form of direct access to their source."

● Inferring the World from Within: The brain only has direct access to its own states 

(e.g., spike trains). The world is "off-limits." The task is not to map environmental states 
to inner states, but to "infer the nature of the signal source (the world) from just the 
varying input signal itself."

● Priors from Experience: The hierarchical structure allows the system to infer its own 
"priors" (prior beliefs or expectations) as it learns. The model at a higher level provides 
the priors for the level below it. These "empirical priors" are constraints that are 
"progressively tuned by the sensory input itself." This process allows the brain's models 

to co-evolve across many layers to best account for the sensory data, creating an 
internal model of the world that is uniquely shaped by experience.

The Bayesian Brain and Probabilistic Representation

The predictive processing framework aligns with the "Bayesian Brain" hypothesis, which posits 
that "the brain represents information probabilistically, by coding and computing with probability 
density functions."

● Representing Uncertainty: The nervous system is fundamentally adapted to handle 
uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity. Instead of representing the world with single, fixed 
values (e.g., "CAT ON MAT"), the brain encodes a conditional probability density 
function, reflecting the relative probability of this state of affairs and any alternatives 
given the available information.

● Context and Priors: This process means perception is heavily "theory-laden." What we 

perceive depends on the set of priors (expectations) the brain brings to bear. In normal 
ecological circumstances, an appropriate set of priors is often already active, ready to 
influence the processing of new sensory information without delay. This means the brain
is not a passive recipient of stimuli but an active preparer for them.

Action-Oriented Predictive Processing

The framework is extended to include action, unifying perception, cognition, and action.

● Action as Fulfilling Prediction: Action works to reduce prediction error not by changing

the internal model (like perception does), but by changing the sensory input itself. 
Agents move their sensors and bodies "to resample the world to fulfil these 
expectations." As Hawkins & Blakeslee (2004) state: "As strange as it sounds, when 
your own behaviour is involved, your predictions not only precede sensation, they 
determine sensation. ... As the cascading prediction unfolds, it generates the motor 
commands necessary to fulfil the prediction."

● Perception and Action as a Unified System: This places perception and action in an 
intimate, co-determining relationship. They work together to minimize prediction errors 
by "selectively sampling, and actively sculpting, the stimulus array."

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

Illuminating Experience: The Case of Delusions in Schizophrenia

Section 4.2 presents a non-pathologizing, mechanistic account of hallucinations and delusions 
that reframes them as a logical outcome of a predictive system attempting to minimize error 
under unusual conditions, rather than a fundamental defect.

● Beyond Two Separate Breakdowns: Traditional views often see hallucinations as a 
"perception" breakdown and delusions as a "belief" breakdown. The PP framework 
suggests a link, as both perception and belief-formation involve matching sensory 
signals with top-down predictions.

● The Role of False Prediction Errors: The model suggests that in schizophrenia, there 
may be disturbances where prediction error signals are falsely generated and, crucially, 
given a high "precision" weighting (i.e., accorded undue salience for driving learning). 
This could be rooted in abnormal dopaminergic functioning.

● A Self-Confirming Cycle: This wave of persistent, highly weighted "false errors" 

propagates up the hierarchy, forcing deep revisions in the person's model of the world. 
"The improbable (telepathy, conspiracy, persecution, etc.) then becomes the least 
surprising," because it is the best hypothesis the system can find to explain away the 
persistent error signals. This new, misinformed model then flows back down, sculpting 
perception to conform to these new, bizarre expectancies. "False perceptions and 
bizarre beliefs thus form an epistemically insulated self-confirming cycle."

● A Unified, Non-Pathologizing Framework: This model merges perception, belief, 

learning, and affect into a single economy. When it malfunctions, "false inferences spiral 
and feed back upon themselves," and "delusion and hallucination then become 
entrenched, being both co-determined and co-determining." This provides a multilevel 
account of altered states of experience without resorting to deficit-based language, 
instead explaining it through the systematic interactions of inference, expectation, and 
learning.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Situated Agents and Cognitive Niche Construction

Section 3.4 describes how the predictive processing framework naturally extends to embodied 
and situated cognition, providing a model for understanding how individuals (especially 
neurodivergent individuals) create adaptive strategies and environments.

● Action as World-Sculpting: Action reduces prediction error by changing the world so 
that inputs conform to expectations. This means perception and action work together to 
"selectively sample and actively sculpt the stimulus array."

● Self-Structuring Information Flows: This concept highlights the importance of our own
actions in structuring sensory input to promote learning and inference. For example, 
manipulating an object provides linked, predictable sensory information across sight, 
touch, and sound.

● Cognitive Niche Construction: "Using a variety of tricks, tools, notations, practices, 

and media, we structure our physical and social worlds so as to make them friendlier for 
brains like ours." This process of "iterated cognitive niche construction" creates 
"designer environments" that allow our brains to develop generative models far beyond 
what simple sensory contact would allow. This is a powerful framework for 
understanding masking and the creation of personalized support systems and coping 
strategies.

● Permeable Minds: The model shows that "human minds [are] permeable, at multiple 
spatial and temporal scales, to the statistical structure of the world as reflected in the 
training signals." When those signals come from a complex, self-constructed "cognitive 
niche," the result is a "repeatedly reconfigured agent" operating in a "repeatedly 
reconfigured world," making the human mind a "constantly moving target." This directly 
argues against static, standardized assessment.
