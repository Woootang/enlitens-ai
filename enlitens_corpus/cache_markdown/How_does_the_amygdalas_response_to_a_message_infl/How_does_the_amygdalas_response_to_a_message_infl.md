Yes, the amygdala’s response to a message amplifies its persuasive impact by
heightening emotional arousal, directing attention, and interacting with value and
executive brain networks to shape attitude and behavior change.

1. Introduction

The amygdala, a key brain region for processing emotional salience, plays a central role in determining how

persuasive a message will be. When a message evokes strong amygdala activation, it increases emotional arousal

and relevance, which in turn enhances attention, memory encoding, and the likelihood of attitude or behavior

change (Doré et al., 2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Ewbank et al., 2009; Huskey et al., 2017; John et al., 2016; Pignatelli

& Beyeler, 2019; Morrison & Salzman, 2010; Vuilleumier, 2005; Doré et al., 2019). The amygdala does not act in

isolation; its influence on persuasion is mediated by interactions with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)

and executive control regions, which together integrate affective, value-based, and cognitive information to

determine the message’s impact (Doré et al., 2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Huskey et al., 2017; Doré et al., 2019). The

strength and direction of the amygdala’s response can be shaped by message features (e.g., threat, hope, narrative

flow), individual differences, and emotion regulation processes (Doré et al., 2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Heffner et al.,

2020; Petty & Briñol, 2015; Nabi & Myrick, 2019; Nabi, 2015; Siegenthaler et al., 2021; Vuilleumier, 2005). This

review synthesizes evidence from neuroimaging, behavioral, and computational studies to clarify how the

amygdala’s response to persuasive messages influences their effectiveness.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The Deep Search process involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8

thematic clusters, focusing on amygdala activation, emotional salience, neural circuits, message features, and

behavioral outcomes in persuasion. In total, 1,018 papers were identified, 719 were screened, 471 were deemed

eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1. Amygdala Activation Predicts Persuasive Impact

•

•

•

Emotional arousal and value encoding: fMRI studies show that increased amygdala activity during exposure to

emotionally evocative messages predicts both individual intentions (e.g., to quit smoking) and population-level

behavior change (Doré et al., 2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Ewbank et al., 2009; Huskey et al., 2017; Morrison &

Salzman, 2010; Vuilleumier, 2005).

Mediation by value networks: The amygdala’s effect on persuasion is mediated by the vmPFC, which

integrates affective signals into subjective value computations that guide decision-making and attitude change

(Doré et al., 2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Huskey et al., 2017; Doré et al., 2019).

Arousal and message strength: Strongly persuasive messages elicit greater amygdala activation than weak

messages, especially when they are emotionally charged or personally relevant (Ramsay et al., 2013; Huskey et

al., 2017; Ewbank et al., 2009; Morrison & Salzman, 2010).

3.2. Amygdala-Executive Network Interactions

•

•

Affective-executive connectivity: Persuasive messages that are highly arousing increase functional

connectivity between the amygdala and executive regions (e.g., lateral prefrontal cortex), supporting the
integration of emotion and cognitive control in attitude change (Ramsay et al., 2013; Huskey et al., 2017; John et
al., 2016; Vuilleumier, 2005).

Emotion regulation: The predictive value of amygdala activation for persuasion is moderated by the degree to
which individuals recruit emotion regulation networks; high regulation can dampen the amygdala’s influence on

behavior (Doré et al., 2019; Buhle et al., 2014; Doré et al., 2019).

3.3. Message Features and Emotional Framing

•

•

•

Valence and framing effects: The amygdala responds to both positive (gain) and negative (loss, threat) frames,
with emotional responses mediating the persuasive impact of both (Nabi et al., 2020; Nabi & Myrick, 2019;

Ewbank et al., 2009; Pignatelli & Beyeler, 2019; Nabi, 2003; Siegenthaler et al., 2021).

Narrative and emotional flow: Messages with dynamic emotional flow or narrative structure sustain amygdala
engagement and enhance persuasive outcomes (Nabi & Green, 2015; Nabi, 2015; Siegenthaler et al., 2021).

Relevance and impact: The amygdala’s response is not solely driven by arousal or valence, but also by the

perceived significance or personal relevance of the message (Ewbank et al., 2009; Pignatelli & Beyeler, 2019;
Vuilleumier, 2005).

3.4. Individual Differences and Moderators

•

•

Personality and susceptibility: Traits such as neuroticism, extraversion, and baseline emotional reactivity

influence the magnitude of amygdala response and, consequently, message effectiveness (Heffner et al., 2020;

Petty & Briñol, 2015; Vuilleumier, 2005).

Reactance and resistance: Overly forceful or threatening messages can trigger psychological reactance, which

may increase amygdala activation but reduce persuasion by shifting attention to counter-arguments or

forbidden behaviors (Reynolds-Tylus, 2019; Sprengholz et al., 2023; Vuilleumier, 2005).

4. Discussion

The amygdala’s response to persuasive messages is a key driver of their effectiveness, acting as an “emotional

gatekeeper” that prioritizes emotionally salient information for further processing and value integration (Doré et al.,

2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Ewbank et al., 2009; Huskey et al., 2017; John et al., 2016; Pignatelli & Beyeler, 2019;

Morrison & Salzman, 2010; Vuilleumier, 2005; Doré et al., 2019). When a message triggers strong amygdala

activation, it increases attention, memory encoding, and the likelihood of attitude or behavior change, especially

when the message is personally relevant or emotionally charged (Doré et al., 2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Ewbank et
al., 2009; Huskey et al., 2017; Pignatelli & Beyeler, 2019; Morrison & Salzman, 2010; Vuilleumier, 2005; Doré et al.,

2019). The amygdala’s influence is not unidirectional; it interacts with value (vmPFC) and executive (lateral PFC)

networks, and its impact can be amplified or dampened by emotion regulation processes and individual differences

(Doré et al., 2019; Ramsay et al., 2013; Buhle et al., 2014; Huskey et al., 2017; Doré et al., 2019).

However, the relationship is complex: excessive arousal or threat can backfire by triggering reactance or defensive

processing, and the amygdala’s response is shaped by both message features and recipient characteristics

(Reynolds-Tylus, 2019; Sprengholz et al., 2023; Vuilleumier, 2005). The amygdala’s role extends beyond simple

arousal, encompassing the detection of significance, relevance, and value, which together determine the

persuasive power of a message (Ewbank et al., 2009; Pignatelli & Beyeler, 2019; Morrison & Salzman, 2010;
Vuilleumier, 2005).

5. Conclusion

The amygdala’s response to persuasive messages amplifies their impact by increasing emotional arousal, attention,

and value integration, but its influence is shaped by message features, individual differences, and regulatory

processes. Effective persuasion leverages the amygdala’s role in detecting emotional significance and relevance,

while avoiding excessive threat or arousal that can trigger resistance.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for the amygdala’s role in persuasion, gaps remain in understanding subregional

specificity, long-term effects, and the interplay with cognitive and social factors in real-world contexts.

5.2. Open Research Questions

Question

Why

How do different amygdala subregions contribute to the
processing of persuasive messages?

Subregional specificity could refine models of
emotional salience and persuasion.

What are the long-term effects of amygdala-driven
persuasion on sustained attitude and behavior change?

Most studies focus on short-term effects; long-
term impact is less understood.

How do social, cognitive, and contextual factors interact with
amygdala responses in real-world persuasion?

Real-world complexity may moderate or amplify
neural effects observed in the lab.

FIGURE  Open research questions for future investigation on amygdala response and persuasive impact.

In summary, the amygdala’s response to a message is a powerful amplifier of its persuasive impact, shaping

attention, memory, and value integration, but its effects depend on message design, individual traits, and

regulatory processes.
