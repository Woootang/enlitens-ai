Yes, epistemic injustice is a significant factor in the mental health of marginalized
communities, contributing to inequities in care, increased stigma, and poorer mental
health outcomes.

1. Introduction

Epistemic injustice—when individuals or groups are wronged specifically in their capacity as knowers—has emerged as a
critical framework for understanding mental health disparities among marginalized communities. Research shows that
marginalized groups (including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and those with
lower socioeconomic status) frequently experience both testimonial injustice (being disbelieved or dismissed) and
hermeneutical injustice (lacking the interpretive resources to make sense of their experiences) within mental health systems
(Bansal et al., 2022; Okoroji et al., 2023; Yates et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Spencer, 2024; Scrutton, 2017; Newbigging &

Ridley, 2018; Fisher, 2023; Kurs & Grinshpoon, 2018; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Hultman &
Hultman, 2023; Crichton et al., 2017). These injustices are perpetuated by structural racism, monocultural models of care,
and the privileging of clinical or biomedical knowledge over lived experience (Shim, 2021; Bansal et al., 2022; Okoroji et al.,
2023; Hui et al., 2021; Spencer, 2024; Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Smith et al., 2023; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022;
Kidd & Carel, 2016; Crichton et al., 2017). The result is a cycle of mistrust, disengagement from services, and exacerbation of
mental health inequities. Addressing epistemic injustice is increasingly recognized as essential for achieving mental health
equity and improving outcomes for marginalized populations (Bansal et al., 2022; Okoroji et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021;
Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Smith et al., 2023; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Crichton et al.,
2017).

2. Methods

3.1 Forms and Mechanisms of Epistemic Injustice

Marginalized individuals experience testimonial injustice when their accounts of distress are doubted or dismissed due to
prejudice, stigma, or negative stereotypes (Okoroji et al., 2023; Yates et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Scrutton, 2017;
Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Fisher, 2023; Kurs & Grinshpoon, 2018; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel,

2016; Hultman & Hultman, 2023; Crichton et al., 2017). Hermeneutical injustice occurs when dominant frameworks fail to
recognize or interpret the unique experiences of marginalized groups, leading to gaps in understanding and care (Bansal et
al., 2022; Okoroji et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Spencer, 2024; Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Fisher, 2023; Kurs & Grinshpoon,
2018; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Hultman & Hultman, 2023; Crichton et al., 2017). Institutional
and structural factors, such as monocultural models of care and lack of cultural competence, further entrench these
injustices (Shim, 2021; Bansal et al., 2022; Hui et al., 2021; Spencer, 2024; Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Smith et al., 2023;
Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Crichton et al., 2017).

3.2 Impact on Mental Health Outcomes

Epistemic injustice contributes to mistrust, disengagement from mental health services, and poorer mental health outcomes
among marginalized groups (Bansal et al., 2022; Okoroji et al., 2023; Yates et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Spencer, 2024;
Scrutton, 2017; Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Fisher, 2023; Kurs & Grinshpoon, 2018; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022;
Kidd & Carel, 2016; Hultman & Hultman, 2023; Crichton et al., 2017). It exacerbates the effects of discrimination, racism, and
social exclusion, compounding the psychological burden and increasing vulnerability to mental health problems (Shim, 2021;
Bansal et al., 2022; Schmitz et al., 2020; Chin et al., 2020; Abu-Ras et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2016; Nazroo et al., 2019; Ricci
et al., 2023; Alvarez et al., 2022; Kapadia, 2023; Slaughter-Acey et al., 2023; Swann et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2013; Schouler-
Ocak & Moran, 2022; Hoy-Ellis, 2021).

3.3 Intersectionality and Compounded Injustice

The effects of epistemic injustice are magnified at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities (e.g., race, gender,
sexuality, disability, class), leading to compounded disadvantage and unique barriers to care (Shim, 2021; Bansal et al., 2022;
Yates et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Schmitz et al., 2020; Chin et al., 2020; Abu-Ras et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2016; Nazroo et
al., 2019; Ricci et al., 2023; Alvarez et al., 2022; Kapadia, 2023; Slaughter-Acey et al., 2023; Swann et al., 2020; Choi et al.,
2013; Schouler-Ocak & Moran, 2022; Hoy-Ellis, 2021). Intersectional stigma and discrimination further limit access to
appropriate, person-centered mental health support (Bansal et al., 2022; Yates et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Schmitz et al.,
2020; Chin et al., 2020; Abu-Ras et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2016; Nazroo et al., 2019; Ricci et al., 2023; Alvarez et al., 2022;

Kapadia, 2023; Slaughter-Acey et al., 2023; Swann et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2013; Schouler-Ocak & Moran, 2022; Hoy-Ellis,
2021).

3.4 Strategies for Addressing Epistemic Injustice

Emerging research highlights the importance of co-production, lived experience leadership, cultural competence, and
structural reform to address epistemic injustice in mental health care and research (Okoroji et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021;
Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Smith et al., 2023; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Crichton et al.,
2017; Groot et al., 2020). Participatory action research and advocacy are identified as promising approaches for promoting
epistemic justice and improving outcomes (Okoroji et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Smith et al.,
2023; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Crichton et al., 2017; Groot et al., 2020).

4. Discussion

The evidence robustly supports epistemic injustice as a significant and pervasive factor in the mental health of marginalized
communities. Testimonial and hermeneutical injustices are embedded in mental health systems, leading to the silencing,

discrediting, and exclusion of marginalized voices (Bansal et al., 2022; Okoroji et al., 2023; Yates et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021;
Spencer, 2024; Scrutton, 2017; Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Fisher, 2023; Kurs & Grinshpoon, 2018; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd

et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Hultman & Hultman, 2023; Crichton et al., 2017). These injustices are not only interpersonal
but also institutional and structural, perpetuated by monocultural models of care, lack of cultural competence, and the

privileging of biomedical knowledge (Shim, 2021; Bansal et al., 2022; Hui et al., 2021; Spencer, 2024; Newbigging & Ridley,
2018; Smith et al., 2023; Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Crichton et al., 2017). The resulting

mistrust and disengagement from services contribute to persistent mental health inequities.

Intersectionality is crucial: individuals with multiple marginalized identities face compounded epistemic injustice and unique

barriers to care (Shim, 2021; Bansal et al., 2022; Yates et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Schmitz et al., 2020; Chin et al., 2020;
Abu-Ras et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2016; Nazroo et al., 2019; Ricci et al., 2023; Alvarez et al., 2022; Kapadia, 2023;

Slaughter-Acey et al., 2023; Swann et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2013; Schouler-Ocak & Moran, 2022; Hoy-Ellis, 2021). Addressing
epistemic injustice requires systemic change, including co-production, lived experience leadership, and culturally

competent, anti-racist models of care (Okoroji et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2021; Newbigging & Ridley, 2018; Smith et al., 2023;
Mooney et al., 2023; Kidd et al., 2022; Kidd & Carel, 2016; Crichton et al., 2017; Groot et al., 2020). While some critiques

question the sufficiency of the epistemic injustice framework for all contexts, the overwhelming consensus is that it is a
powerful tool for understanding and addressing mental health inequities (Harcourt, 2021; Degerman, 2023; Lores & Aguilar,

2023).
