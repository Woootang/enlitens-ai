Yes, increased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity is closely linked to the
experience of cognitive dissonance during persuasion, reflecting conflict
detection, affective evaluation, and predicting subsequent attitude change.

1. Introduction

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key brain region implicated in monitoring cognitive conflict, evaluating

competing information, and regulating adaptive behavior. During persuasion, when individuals encounter messages

that challenge their existing beliefs or attitudes, they often experience cognitive dissonance—a psychological

discomfort arising from holding conflicting cognitions. Neuroimaging and lesion studies consistently show that the

ACC is activated during such dissonant states, particularly when persuasive messages induce internal conflict or

require attitude change (Veen et al., 2009; Botvinick et al., 1999; Veen et al., 2001; Carter & Veen, 2007; Carter et

al., 2000). The magnitude of ACC activation not only reflects the degree of experienced dissonance but also

predicts the likelihood and direction of subsequent attitude change (Veen et al., 2009). The ACC’s role extends to

affective evaluation, error detection, and the dynamic regulation of cognitive control, making it central to

understanding how persuasion leads to belief updating or resistance (Duggirala et al., 2022; Vassena et al., 2020;

Mohanty et al., 2007; Davis et al., 2005; Braem et al., 2017; Bush et al., 2022).

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The Deep Search process involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8
thematic clusters, focusing on ACC activity, cognitive dissonance, conflict monitoring, affective evaluation, and

attitude change during persuasion. In total, 1,025 papers were identified, 563 were screened, 319 were deemed

eligible, and the top 29 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. ACC Activity and Cognitive Dissonance

•

•

•

Direct evidence: fMRI studies show that the dorsal ACC is robustly activated when individuals are exposed to

persuasive messages that conflict with their prior attitudes, a hallmark of cognitive dissonance (Veen et al.,

2009). The degree of ACC activation predicts the extent of subsequent attitude change, supporting its role in

dissonance resolution (Veen et al., 2009).

Conflict monitoring: The ACC is sensitive to the detection of conflict between competing cognitions or

response tendencies, as seen in classic tasks like the Stroop paradigm and in persuasive contexts (Botvinick et

al., 1999; Veen et al., 2001; Carter & Veen, 2007; Carter et al., 2000).

Affective evaluation: The ACC not only detects conflict but also encodes the aversive, affective component of

dissonance, signaling the need for cognitive or behavioral adjustment (Braem et al., 2017).

3.2. Functional Differentiation within the ACC

•

•

Subregional specialization: Dorsal ACC (dACC) is more involved in cognitive conflict and performance

monitoring, while rostral/ventral ACC (rACC/vACC) is implicated in affective evaluation and emotion regulation

during dissonance (Mohanty et al., 2007; Lindsay et al., 2023; Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2018; Braem et al.,
2017).

Dynamic regulation: The ACC interacts with prefrontal and limbic regions to modulate attention, emotion, and

control in response to persuasive conflict (Mohanty et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2020; Lockwood & Wittmann,
2018; Lindsay et al., 2023; Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2018).

3.3. Predictive Value and Attitude Change

•

•

Neural predictors: The magnitude of ACC activation during dissonance predicts the likelihood and direction of

attitude change, with higher activation associated with greater change (Veen et al., 2009).

Lesion evidence: Damage to the ACC impairs the ability to adaptively regulate cognitive control and resolve

dissonance, leading to reduced flexibility in attitude change (Pellegrino et al., 2007).

3.4. Broader Theoretical and Methodological Insights

•

•

Multiple signals: The ACC encodes not only conflict but also surprise, value, and the need for behavioral

adaptation, making it a hub for integrating cognitive and affective signals during persuasion (Kolling et al., 2016;
Vassena et al., 2020; Hyman et al., 2017; Bush et al., 2022).

Alternative views: Some recent lesion and computational studies suggest that while ACC activity is a robust

correlate of conflict and dissonance, it may not be strictly necessary for all forms of cognitive control or attitude
change, indicating a distributed network (Cipolotti et al., 2024; Roelofs et al., 2006).

4. Discussion

The relationship between ACC activity and cognitive dissonance during persuasion is well-supported by

converging evidence from neuroimaging, lesion, and computational studies. The ACC acts as a conflict detector,

signaling when persuasive messages clash with existing beliefs and triggering affective discomfort that motivates

attitude change (Veen et al., 2009; Botvinick et al., 1999; Veen et al., 2001; Carter & Veen, 2007; Carter et al.,

2000). Subregional specialization within the ACC allows for both cognitive and affective evaluation of dissonance,

and its dynamic interaction with other brain regions supports flexible adaptation (Mohanty et al., 2007; Lindsay et
al., 2023; Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2018; Braem et al., 2017). The predictive value of ACC activation for attitude

change highlights its central role in the neural mechanisms of persuasion (Veen et al., 2009). However, some recent

work suggests that while ACC activity is a robust marker, it may not be strictly necessary for all forms of cognitive

control, pointing to a distributed network for dissonance resolution (Cipolotti et al., 2024; Roelofs et al., 2006).

5. Conclusion

Increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex is a robust neural marker of cognitive dissonance during

persuasion, reflecting conflict detection, affective discomfort, and the likelihood of attitude change. The ACC’s role

is central but operates within a broader network supporting adaptive belief updating.
