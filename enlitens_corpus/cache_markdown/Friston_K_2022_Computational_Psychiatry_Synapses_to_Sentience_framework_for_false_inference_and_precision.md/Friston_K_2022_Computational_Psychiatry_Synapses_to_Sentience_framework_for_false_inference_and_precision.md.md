DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This expert review by Karl Friston presents a comprehensive framework for "strong" 
computational psychiatry, which seeks to explain psychopathology through underlying 
pathophysiology. The central argument is that the brain operates as an inferential organ, 
constantly creating and testing predictive models of the world, a process termed "active 
inference." From this perspective, psychopathology is fundamentally "false inference," arising 
from "synaptopathies" (dysfunctional synapses) that impair the brain's ability to precisely 
modulate the balance between sensory evidence (bottom-up) and prior beliefs (top-down). This 
paper provides a core scientific foundation for Enlitens by arguing against simplistic, descriptive 
models (like standardized testing) and advocating for individualized approaches that aim to 
understand each person's unique generative model, a process it calls "computational 
phenotyping."

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "The narrative starts with the simple premise that if psychology— read as belief updating

in the brain—can be cast as a computational process of inference, it follows that 
psychopathology just is false inference."

● "The common theme that distinguishes weak from strong approaches is reference to a 

generative model: namely, a hypothesis about causal mechanisms, specified formally as
a joint probability distribution over some (unobservable, latent or hidden) causes and 
their (observable, measurable) consequences."

● "In short, many psychiatric, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders could be 

described as arising from pernicious synaptopathies that lead to a functional 
disintegration of neuronal message passing in cortical and subcortical hierarchies."

● "...many psychiatric and neurological disorders can be framed in terms of a 

synaptopathy that confounds the encoding of uncertainty or precision in a (Bayesian) 
brain..."

● "Since that time, it has become difficult to find a psychiatric condition that has not been 
considered through the lens of aberrant precision, in one form or another [21, 135, 137–
161]."

● "It means that any given patient can be fully characterised by her prior beliefs under 

ideal (active Bayesian inference) observer assumptions."

● "This motivates the difficult game of inferring what generative model this subject is using,

based purely upon their behavioural or neuronal responses [204–206]."

● "One obvious advantage of being able to create a 'digital twin' of a patient in silico, is the 
ability to perform synthetic lesion studies and psychopharmacology, to test various 
hypotheses about the effect of therapeutic interventions."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● "For example, a recent genome-wide association study [122] of 76,755 individuals with 
schizophrenia highlights the importance of GRIN2A (which encodes a subunit of the 
NMDA receptor), while a recent meta-analysis of whole exomes [123] emphasises the 
role of GRIN2A, as well as GRIA3 (which encodes a subunit of the AMPA receptor)."
● A study on schizophrenia concluded that EEG responses in three classic paradigms are 
all attributable to "greater self-inhibition in pyramidal cells" and that psychotic symptoms 
relate to "disinhibition in neural circuits". These findings support the hypothesis that "a 
primary loss of synaptic gain on pyramidal cells is then compensated by interneuron 
downregulation (rather than the converse)".

● In patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, it was shown that "the phasic 

inhibition of deep cortico-cortical pyramidal neurons following tiagabine, but not placebo, 
was a function of GABA concentration" [199]."

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

"Strong" vs. "Weak" Computational Approaches

The paper distinguishes between two types of computational methods, arguing for the 
superiority of "strong," theory-led approaches.

● Weak Approaches: These are descriptive or theory-free, such as behaviorism, 

analyzing correlation patterns in fMRI (functional connectivity), or using 'big data' and 
deep learning without a mechanistic model. These methods lack explanatory power. For 
example, "the correlation of a source with itself tells you nothing (it is always one)".
● Strong Approaches: These are hypothesis-led and rest on a "generative model"—a 
formal hypothesis about the causal mechanisms that produce observable data. This 
allows for mechanistic interpretation and explanation. Examples include active inference,

effective connectivity analysis, and generative adversarial networks. The paper 
advocates for this approach as it allows for comparing the evidence for different models.

Computational Phenotyping and Nosology

This is presented as a "strong" approach to characterizing individual patients, moving beyond 
simple classification.

● Core Principle: The complete class theorem suggests that for any behavior, there 

exists a set of prior beliefs that would make that behavior Bayes optimal. This implies 
"that any given patient can be fully characterised by her prior beliefs under ideal (active 
Bayesian inference) observer assumptions".

● Method: The goal is to infer the generative model a subject is using based on their 

behavioral or neuronal responses. This is sometimes called "generative embedding". 
This approach can be more efficient for classifying or stratifying patients than using their 
raw responses.

● Computational Nosology: This extends the idea to model the slow, dynamic processes
of pathophysiology and psychopathology over time. Conventional diagnoses are not 
used to stratify patients but as "data features that supply evidence for or against models 
of the mapping between pathophysiology and psychopathology that are hidden from 
direct observation".

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Psychopathology as False Inference

"The narrative starts with the simple premise that if psychology— read as belief updating in the 
brain—can be cast as a computational process of inference, it follows that psychopathology just 
is false inference. False inference is meant in the usual sense of false positives (i.e., type I 
errors); namely, inferring something is there when it is not. Cardinal examples here include 
hallucinations, delusions and other features of reality distortion seen in psychosis. False 
negatives (i.e., type II errors) mean inferring something is not there when it is; for example, 
dissociative disorders, neglect syndromes, derealisation phenomena, et cetera. Indeed, when 
one thinks about psychiatric and neurological disorders, most can be framed as false inference: 
ranging from dysmorphophobia in eating disorders, through to delusional systems in paranoid 
schizophrenia; from phobias through to Parkinson's disease."

The Importance of Precision Engineering

Precision is the confidence or certainty afforded to prediction errors, which is biologically 
encoded by the gain or excitability of neuronal populations. This mechanism is central to 
attention.

"Affording certain prediction errors greater precision increases their influence on belief updating 
and has all the hallmarks of attentional selection [80–85]. Physiologically, this simply entails an 
increase in the excitability or postsynaptic gain of neuronal populations broadcasting prediction 
errors. ... One crucial aspect of this precision engineering is that it underwrites our ability to filter
out—or ignore—certain prediction errors when they are deemed imprecise. A key example is 

the attenuation of sensory prediction errors that report the consequences of movement [93–98). 
If we could not ignore the proprioceptive and somatosensory afferents—supplying evidence that
we are not moving—then any beliefs about intended or predicted movement would be revised 
immediately, and we would not be able to initiate movement." This failure of "sensory 
attenuation" is a key theme across many conditions.

Synaptopathy and Dysconnection as the Root of False Inference

The paper argues that false inference stems from biological issues at the synaptic level. "In 
short, one could neatly summarise the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurological 
conditions in terms of one or more forms of synaptopathy [108]. Synaptopathy is taken to mean 
any failure of synaptic function due to a variety of pathological mechanisms (i.e., formation, 
structure, metabolism, etc.). ... A coarse-grained overview of the synaptic theories of 
schizophrenia suggests that the synaptopathy in question is of a neuromodulatory sort; 
implicating classical neuromodulatory (ascending) neurotransmitter systems [110–113), 
GABAergic neurotransmission and NMDA receptors [113–116]...".

This leads to the central thesis: "the psychopathology (i.e., false inference) characteristic of 
psychiatric disorders may be attributable to aberrant precision control, which inherits from 
synaptopathies that confound neuromodulation."

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

The paper frames various conditions through the lens of aberrant precision and sensory 
attenuation:

● A Crosscutting Theme: "A crosscutting theme in many of these accounts is a putative 
failure of sensory attenuation... A failure of sensory attenuation implies an imbalance 
between the precision afforded sensory prediction errors and the precision of prediction 
errors deeper in neuronal hierarchies that mediate or maintain prior beliefs... The 
ensuing imbalance is often read as a loss of precision or confidence in prior beliefs, 
relative to the sensory evidence at hand."

● Autism: "In autism, this imbalance is consistent with a failure of sensory attenuation and

an inability to ignore the sensorium, which may or may not be associated with the 
neuromodulatory role of oxytocin [135, 166–170]."

● Schizophrenia: "...a failure of sensory attenuation provides an apt explanation for 

resistance to illusions (that normally depend upon precise prior beliefs) and failures to 
elicit mismatch oddball responses (because everything is surprising). Some people then 
interpret delusional ideation as the brain's attempt to make sense of unattenuated 
prediction errors... However, hallucinatory phenomena require a slightly more delicate 
argument; usually along the lines of a compensatory increase in prior precision that 
could manifest as a form of paradoxical lesion. In other words, in attempt to override 
precise sensory prediction errors, higher levels learn to ignore sensory evidence and— 
sequestered from the sensorium—elaborate false percepts."

● Other Conditions: The framework is applied broadly, "ranging from failures of sensory 
attenuation in autonomic and interoceptive inference, through depression and emotional 
processing [82, 140, 149, 174], to functional medical symptoms and dissociative 
phenomena [137, 164]."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

In Vivo Assays of Synaptic Efficacy

"...this calls for in vivo and ex vivo assays of synaptic efficacy [178, 179] that can be deployed 
across scale; i.e., from molecular biology through to patients in the clinic (or bedside)." Dynamic 
Causal Modelling (DCM) is presented as the primary "strong" approach for this in imaging 
neuroscience. It models neuronal dynamics to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity, 
allowing researchers to assess the evidence for changes in synaptic efficacy.

Computational Neuropsychology (The "Digital Twin")

"A final part of the narrative is that a generative model of pathophysiology, and ensuing 
psychopathology, allows one to perform in silico or synthetic experiments [212–214]. These 
entail optimising the parameters of a model of a particular subject or cohort, and seeing what 
would happen if one increased or decreased certain synaptic efficacies, e.g., [197]. ... One 
obvious advantage of being able to create a 'digital twin' of a patient in silico, is the ability to 
perform synthetic lesion studies and psychopharmacology, to test various hypotheses about the
effect of therapeutic interventions."
