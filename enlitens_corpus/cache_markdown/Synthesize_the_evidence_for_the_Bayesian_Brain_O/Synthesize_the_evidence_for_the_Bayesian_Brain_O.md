The Bayesian Brain and Predictive Coding as Models for Psychological Distress:
A Synthesis of the Evidence

1. Introduction

The "Bayesian brain" and "predictive coding" frameworks propose that the brain is fundamentally a prediction

machine, constantly generating and updating models of the world to minimize prediction errors between expected

and actual sensory input. These models have gained significant traction in explaining psychological distress and

psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, depression, and anxiety. The core idea is that maladaptive inferences—

arising from aberrant weighting of prior beliefs versus sensory evidence—can lead to symptoms such as

hallucinations, delusions, and affective disturbances. Recent research supports the utility of these frameworks for

unifying cognitive, neurobiological, and computational perspectives on mental illness, while also highlighting

challenges and the need for further empirical validation (Sterzer et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2018; Adams et al., 2013;

2020; Yamashita, 2021; Sterzer et al., 2016).

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search strategy included 20 targeted queries across 8 thematic groups,

focusing on foundational theory, clinical applications, mechanistic decomposition, and critiques of the Bayesian

brain and predictive coding in psychological distress. In total, 1,023 papers were identified, 705 were screened, 435

were deemed eligible, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1. Core Principles and Theoretical Foundations

•

•

•

Bayesian Brain Hypothesis: The brain is conceptualized as an inference machine, using probabilistic (Bayesian)

models to combine prior beliefs with sensory evidence, updating beliefs to minimize prediction error (Adams et

al., 2013; Adams et al., 2014; Corlett et al., 2009; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Smith et al., 2020; Petzschner et al.,

2017; Yamashita, 2021; Sterzer et al., 2016).

Predictive Coding: This framework posits a hierarchical system where higher-level predictions are compared to

lower-level sensory input, and mismatches (prediction errors) drive learning and perception (Sterzer et al., 2018;

Adams et al., 2013; Adams et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2022; Corlett et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2020; Harding et al.,

2024; Qela et al., 2025; Fong et al., 2020; Sterzer et al., 2016).

Precision Weighting: The relative confidence (precision) assigned to priors versus sensory data is crucial;

aberrant precision weighting is implicated in various psychiatric symptoms (Sterzer et al., 2018; Adams et al.,

2013; Adams et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2022; Corlett et al., 2009; Harding et al., 2024; Qela et al., 2025; Sterzer

et al., 2016).

3.2. Application to Psychosis and Schizophrenia

•

•

Psychosis: Aberrant predictive coding is proposed to underlie psychotic symptoms, with either weakened or
overly strong priors leading to hallucinations and delusions. Disrupted precision encoding can result in

maladaptive learning and false inferences (Sterzer et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2018; Adams et al., 2013; Adams et
al., 2014; Corlett et al., 2009; Harding et al., 2024; Qela et al., 2025; Fong et al., 2020; Sterzer et al., 2016).

Empirical Evidence: Studies using computational modeling, neuroimaging, and pharmacological manipulations
(e.g., NMDA antagonists) support the role of hierarchical prediction errors and precision weighting in psychosis

(Sterzer et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2018; Adams et al., 2013; Corlett et al., 2009; Harding et al., 2024; Qela et al.,

2025; Weber et al., 2019; Fong et al., 2020; Sterzer et al., 2016).

3.3. Application to Depression, Anxiety, and Other Disorders

•

•

•

Depression: Disrupted reward prediction error signaling and impaired generative predictions are linked to
anhedonia and negative cognitive bias. Predictive coding models explain how maladaptive priors about the self

and the world contribute to depressive symptoms (Gilbert et al., 2022; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Smith et al.,

2020; Van De Cruys & Van Dessel, 2021; Manjaly & Iglesias, 2019; Fong et al., 2020; Yamashita, 2021).

Anxiety and OCD: Excessive uncertainty and maladaptive belief updating, as formalized in Bayesian models,

are implicated in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Fradkin et al., 2020; Van De Cruys & Van Dessel,

2021; Van Den Bergh et al., 2020; Yamashita, 2021).

Transdiagnostic Utility: Predictive coding deficits are observed across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders,

including autism and mood disorders, with disorder-specific patterns of impairment (Qela et al., 2025; Van De

Cruys & Van Dessel, 2021; Bolis et al., 2017; Fong et al., 2020).

2 / 8

3.4. Mechanistic and Clinical Implications

•

•

•

Neurobiological Correlates: Predictive coding is linked to specific neural circuits (e.g., hippocampal-prefrontal-

striatal networks) and neurotransmitter systems (e.g., dopamine, NMDA receptors) (Heinz et al., 2018; Adams et
al., 2013; Adams et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2022; Corlett et al., 2009; Harding et al., 2024; Qela et al., 2025;

Weber et al., 2019; Fong et al., 2020; Sterzer et al., 2016).

Computational Psychiatry: Bayesian and predictive coding models are increasingly used to formalize and
simulate psychiatric symptoms, offering mechanistic insights and potential for personalized interventions

(Adams et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2020; Huys et al., 2020; Petzschner et al., 2017; Manjaly & Iglesias, 2019; Huys

et al., 2016; Yamashita, 2021).

Limitations and Critiques: Challenges include the heterogeneity of findings, difficulty in empirically

constraining models, and the need for more direct clinical applications (Sterzer et al., 2018; Harding et al., 2024;

Qela et al., 2025; Haarsma et al., 2020; Fong et al., 2020; Yamashita, 2021).

4. Discussion

The Bayesian brain and predictive coding frameworks offer a powerful, unifying account of psychological distress,

integrating cognitive, neurobiological, and computational levels of explanation. They provide mechanistic models

for how aberrant inference and maladaptive learning can give rise to symptoms across a range of psychiatric

disorders, from psychosis to depression and anxiety (Sterzer et al., 2018; Adams et al., 2013; Gilbert et al., 2022;
Corlett et al., 2009; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Smith et al., 2020; Harding et al., 2024; Qela et al., 2025; Van De

Cruys & Van Dessel, 2021; Petzschner et al., 2017; Fong et al., 2020; Yamashita, 2021; Sterzer et al., 2016). Empirical

studies using neuroimaging, computational modeling, and pharmacological interventions support key predictions

of these models, such as the role of precision weighting and hierarchical prediction errors (Sterzer et al., 2018;

Heinz et al., 2018; Adams et al., 2013; Gilbert et al., 2022; Corlett et al., 2009; Harding et al., 2024; Qela et al., 2025;

Weber et al., 2019; Fong et al., 2020; Sterzer et al., 2016).

However, the field faces challenges, including heterogeneity in findings (e.g., whether priors are weakened or

strengthened in psychosis), the need for more precise empirical constraints, and the translation of computational

models into clinical practice (Sterzer et al., 2018; Harding et al., 2024; Qela et al., 2025; Haarsma et al., 2020; Fong

et al., 2020; Yamashita, 2021). There is also ongoing debate about the specificity of predictive coding deficits to
particular disorders and the best ways to measure and manipulate these processes in humans.

5. Conclusion

The Bayesian brain and predictive coding models provide a robust, mechanistic framework for understanding

psychological distress, with strong support across psychosis, depression, and other disorders. They unify cognitive,

neurobiological, and computational perspectives, though further empirical and clinical work is needed to refine and
apply these models.
