Synthesize the research on how an therapist's autonomic state influences a
client's physiological state.

Therapist Autonomic State and Client Physiological State: Synthesis of
Research

Research consistently demonstrates that a therapist’s autonomic state can influence a client’s physiological state

through processes such as physiological synchrony, emotional coregulation, and interpersonal attunement.

Physiological Synchrony and Coregulation

Multiple studies show that therapists and clients often exhibit physiological synchrony—their autonomic nervous

system (ANS) activity (e.g., heart rate, respiration, skin conductance) becomes aligned during sessions. This

synchrony is dynamic and can occur in both in-phase (matching) and antiphase (complementary) patterns,

depending on the emotional context and therapeutic process (Tschacher & Meier, 2019; Bar-Kalifa et al., 2023;

Goren et al., 2024; Seikkula et al., 2015; Avdi & Evans, 2020; Prinz et al., 2021; Palumbo et al., 2017).

Therapist-led synchrony (where the client’s physiological state tracks the therapist’s earlier state) is associated

with more positive client emotions and reduced anxiety and depression (Prinz et al., 2021).

Bidirectional influence is observed: therapists’ and clients’ ANS states can affect each other moment-to-

moment, with therapist responsiveness to client arousal supporting better client outcomes (Goren et al., 2024;

Bar-Kalifa et al., 2023; Soma et al., 2019).

Emotional coregulation occurs, where increases in therapist arousal can slow increases in client arousal, and

vice versa, promoting emotional stability (Soma et al., 2019).

Mechanisms and Clinical Implications

•

•

Therapist presence and regulation: Therapists who maintain stable, regulated autonomic states may help

clients achieve physiological calm and emotional safety, supporting therapeutic alliance and positive outcomes

(Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019; Rolnick & Ehrenreich, 2019; Del Piccolo & Finset, 2017; Avdi & Evans, 2020).

Empathy and attunement: Higher physiological synchrony is linked to greater perceived empathy and stronger

therapeutic bonds (Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019; Avdi & Evans, 2020).

Communication style: Patient-centered, calming therapist behaviors can attenuate client autonomic arousal,
while tension or antagonism can increase it (Dimascio et al., 1957; Del Piccolo & Finset, 2017).

Conclusion

The therapist’s autonomic state is not isolated; it dynamically interacts with the client’s physiological state through

synchrony and coregulation. Therapists who maintain regulated, attuned states can foster client physiological
safety, enhance emotional regulation, and strengthen the therapeutic alliance, ultimately supporting better clinical

outcomes.
