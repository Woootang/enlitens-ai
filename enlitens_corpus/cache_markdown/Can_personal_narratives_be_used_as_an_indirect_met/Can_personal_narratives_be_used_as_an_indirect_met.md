Yes, personal narratives can be effectively used as an indirect method to educate
audiences on sensitive topics.

1. Introduction

Personal narratives—first-person accounts of lived experience—are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for

educating audiences about sensitive, stigmatized, or complex topics. Research across health, education, policy,

and advocacy demonstrates that narratives can foster empathy, reduce stigma, enhance engagement, and promote

critical reflection among learners and the public (Dudley et al., 2023; Mcginty et al., 2017; Heley et al., 2020; Coret

et al., 2018; Milner, 2007; Frank et al., 2015; Legere et al., 2013; Parnell et al., 2023; Kagawa et al., 2023; Dahlstrom,

2014). These effects are observed in diverse contexts, from medical and nursing education to public health

campaigns, social justice movements, and policy advocacy (Mcginty et al., 2017; Trevisan, 2017; Miller et al., 2020;

McEntire et al., 2015; Frank et al., 2015; Kumagai, 2008; Parnell et al., 2023). Narratives are particularly valuable for

addressing topics that are difficult to discuss directly, such as mental illness, substance use, disability, sexuality,

and social inequities, by making abstract or taboo issues relatable and emotionally resonant (Mcginty et al., 2017;

Heley et al., 2020; Milner, 2007; Frank et al., 2015; Parnell et al., 2023; Kagawa et al., 2023). However, the impact of

personal narratives depends on factors such as narrative quality, context, audience characteristics, and the

integration of narrative with other educational strategies (Dudley et al., 2023; Shaffer et al., 2018; Polletta &

Redman, 2020; Drewniak et al., 2020; Dahlstrom, 2014). While most evidence supports the educational value of

personal narratives, some studies caution about potential risks, such as narrative bias or the reinforcement of

stereotypes if not carefully curated (Fadlallah et al., 2019; Drewniak et al., 2020; Chen, 2018). Overall, the literature
supports the use of personal narratives as an indirect yet effective method for educating audiences on sensitive

topics.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search targeted studies on personal narratives, storytelling, and
narrative-based interventions for education on sensitive or stigmatized topics. In total, 1,018 papers were identified,

718 were screened, 478 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1 Effectiveness of Personal Narratives in Education

Personal narratives have been shown to increase empathy, reduce stigma, and improve understanding of sensitive
topics in both formal and informal educational settings (Dudley et al., 2023; Mcginty et al., 2017; Heley et al., 2020;

Coret et al., 2018; Milner, 2007; Frank et al., 2015; Legere et al., 2013; Parnell et al., 2023; Kagawa et al., 2023;

Dahlstrom, 2014). In health education, narrative medicine and patient storytelling interventions enhance learners'
appreciation of patient perspectives and foster humanistic care (Han et al., 2024; Coret et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2023;

Brady & Revell, 2025; Kumagai, 2008; Parnell et al., 2023; Kagawa et al., 2023). In policy and advocacy, personal

stories can shift public attitudes and increase support for evidence-based policies (Mcginty et al., 2017; Trevisan,
2017; McEntire et al., 2015; Frank et al., 2015; Hippalgaonkar et al., 2024).

3.2 Mechanisms and Contexts

Narratives work by engaging emotions, promoting identification with storytellers, and making abstract or

stigmatized issues concrete and relatable (Dudley et al., 2023; Frank et al., 2015; Shaffer et al., 2018; Chen & Bell,

2021; Dahlstrom, 2014). They are particularly effective when combined with didactic methods, tailored to the
audience, and presented in first-person or multimedia formats (Dudley et al., 2023; Frank et al., 2015; Chen & Bell,

2021; Dahlstrom, 2014). Digital storytelling and visual narratives further enhance engagement and accessibility (Tran

et al., 2024; Moreau et al., 2018; Hoffman, 2021; Efthymiou, 2025; Parnell et al., 2023).

3.3 Applications Across Domains

Personal narratives are used in medical, nursing, and pharmacy education to teach about mental health, disability,

cultural competence, and ethical values (Han et al., 2024; Coret et al., 2018; Tran et al., 2024; Moreau et al., 2018;
Zhou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Brady & Revell, 2025; Kumagai, 2008; Hoffman, 2021; Parnell et al., 2023;

Kagawa et al., 2023). In social justice and advocacy, crowd-sourced and counter-narratives challenge dominant

discourses and promote equity (Trevisan, 2017; Miller et al., 2020; Bhattacharya, 2016; McEntire et al., 2015; Chen,
2018; Qiu, 2023; Vromen et al., 2025). In public health, narrative messages reduce stigma and improve health

literacy (Mcginty et al., 2017; Dudley et al., 2023; Heley et al., 2020; Frank et al., 2015; Zexin & Rong, 2025;

Drewniak et al., 2020; Dahlstrom, 2014).

3.4 Limitations and Risks

While generally effective, narratives can sometimes reinforce stereotypes, introduce bias, or be misused for

persuasion rather than education (Fadlallah et al., 2019; Shaffer et al., 2018; Polletta & Redman, 2020; Chen, 2018;
Drewniak et al., 2020). The impact of narratives varies by topic, audience, and delivery method, and not all narrative

interventions are equally effective (Dudley et al., 2023; Fadlallah et al., 2019; Moreau et al., 2018; Shaffer et al.,

2018; Polletta & Redman, 2020; Drewniak et al., 2020; Dahlstrom, 2014).

4. Discussion

The literature provides strong evidence that personal narratives are effective indirect tools for educating audiences

on sensitive topics. Narratives foster empathy, reduce stigma, and make complex or taboo issues accessible and
relatable (Dudley et al., 2023; Mcginty et al., 2017; Heley et al., 2020; Coret et al., 2018; Milner, 2007; Frank et al.,

2015; Legere et al., 2013; Parnell et al., 2023; Kagawa et al., 2023; Dahlstrom, 2014). They are particularly valuable in

health professions education, where they enhance humanistic care and communication skills (Han et al., 2024;

Coret et al., 2018; Moreau et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Brady & Revell, 2025; Kumagai, 2008;

Hoffman, 2021; Parnell et al., 2023; Kagawa et al., 2023). In policy and advocacy, personal stories can shift public

attitudes and increase support for evidence-based interventions (Mcginty et al., 2017; Trevisan, 2017; McEntire et

al., 2015; Frank et al., 2015; Hippalgaonkar et al., 2024). The mechanisms underlying these effects include emotional
engagement, identification, and narrative immersion (Dudley et al., 2023; Frank et al., 2015; Shaffer et al., 2018;

Chen & Bell, 2021; Dahlstrom, 2014).

However, the use of personal narratives is not without risks. Poorly designed or inauthentic narratives can reinforce
stereotypes, introduce bias, or be used manipulatively (Fadlallah et al., 2019; Shaffer et al., 2018; Polletta & Redman,

2020; Chen, 2018; Drewniak et al., 2020). The effectiveness of narratives depends on context, audience, and

integration with other educational strategies (Dudley et al., 2023; Fadlallah et al., 2019; Moreau et al., 2018; Shaffer

et al., 2018; Polletta & Redman, 2020; Drewniak et al., 2020; Dahlstrom, 2014). Ethical considerations, such as

protecting the privacy and dignity of storytellers, are also paramount (McElhinney & Kennedy, 2022; Fadlallah et al.,

2019; Chen, 2018; Drewniak et al., 2020).

5. Conclusion

Personal narratives are a well-supported, effective indirect method for educating audiences on sensitive topics,

with demonstrated benefits for empathy, stigma reduction, and engagement. Their impact is maximized when
narratives are authentic, contextually relevant, and ethically integrated with other educational strategies.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for the effectiveness of personal narratives, gaps remain in understanding their long-term

impact, optimal delivery methods, and potential unintended consequences. More rigorous, comparative, and

longitudinal studies are needed, especially in non-health domains and diverse populations.
