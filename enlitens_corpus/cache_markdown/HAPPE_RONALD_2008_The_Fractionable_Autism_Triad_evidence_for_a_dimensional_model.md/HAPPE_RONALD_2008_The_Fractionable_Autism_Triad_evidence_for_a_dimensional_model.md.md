DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This review by Francesca Happé and Angelica Ronald presents the "Fractionable Autism Triad" 
hypothesis, a landmark argument that directly challenges the traditional, unitary view of autism. 
The authors marshal extensive evidence from behavioral, genetic, cognitive, and neural 
research to argue that the three core domains of autism—social impairments, communication 
difficulties, and restricted/repetitive behaviors (RRBIs)—are largely independent and have 
distinct underlying causes. This paper is a foundational text for Enlitens because it provides the 
scientific basis for a dimensional, rather than categorical, approach to assessment. It dismantles
the idea that autism is a single entity that one either "has" or "doesn't have," supporting Enlitens'
clinical interview model which seeks to understand an individual's unique profile of traits across 
multiple, separable domains.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLETINS

● "There has been a strong presumption that these different features of the syndrome are 
strongly intertwined and proceed from a common cause at the genetic, cognitive and 
neural levels. In this review we examine evidence for an alternative approach, 
considering the triad as largely 'fractionable'."

● "We suggest that largely independent genes may operate on social skills/impairments, 
communication abilities, and RRBIs, requiring a change in molecular-genetic research 
approaches."

● "At the cognitive level, we suggest that satisfactory accounts exist for each of the triad 

domains, but no single unitary account can explain both social and nonsocial features of 
autism."

● "The circularity involved in defining a sample and then finding differences in that sample 
which may be related to the definition of the sample has been an ongoing problem in this
area."

● "The question arises whether one should conceptualize autism and related disorders as 

lying on one spectrum, or whether each individual should be mapped in a three 
dimensional space along three, perhaps orthogonal, dimensions: social interaction, 
communication, and RRBIs."

● "A major implication of our twin results is that molecular genetic studies looking for 

susceptibility genes for autism may have more success finding genes associated with 
specific behaviors within autism than with autism as a whole."

EVIDENCE FOR THE 'FRACTIONABLE 
AUTISM TRIAD'

Behavioral & Population-Level Evidence

Population-based studies show that the three trait domains of autism do not strongly cluster 
together and frequently appear in isolation.

● "In our population-based studies, using data from over 3,000 twin pairs assessed 

between ages 7 and 9 years old, we have found modest-to-low correlations between 
autistic-like behavioral traits in the three core areas (Ronald et al. 2005, 2006a)."

● "Somewhat to our surprise, even social and communication impairments which are often

seen as almost indistinguishable in real life... were only modestly related, with 
correlations in the range of 0.2 to 0.4."

● "This relationship was no stronger than that between communicative difficulties and 

RRBI (correlations in the range of 0.3–0.4), while social impairments and RRBI were the 
least strongly linked (0.1–0.3)."

● "Indeed, within our large population-based sample, a considerable number of children 
showed isolated difficulties in only one area of the autistic triad... For example, 59% of 
children who showed social impairments showed only social impairments."

Genetic Evidence for Fractionation

Twin studies demonstrate that while each component of the triad is highly heritable, they are 
influenced by largely different sets of genes.

● "Multivariate model-fitting analyses of cross-twin cross-trait correlations suggested that 
more than half the genes that contribute to variation in, say, social (dis)ability are 
independent from those that contribute to variation in communicative skills or 
rigid/repetitive tendencies (Ronald et al. 2005, 2006a,b)."

● "Thus, most of the genetic effects, at least in middle childhood, are specific, acting on 

just one part of the triad."

● "These results suggested that at the extreme end of the normal distribution, there were 
some genetic influences shared between the three different autistic traits but also 
evidence for genetic influences that were specific to each type of autistic behavior."
● "Family studies have... shown that it is not only autism itself that is heritable, but that 
relatives show increased rates of the ‘broader autism phenotype’, which refers to 
subclinical manifestations of all or part of the triad of autistic features. Importantly, some 
relatives show only isolated traits, for example communication difficulties without social 
impairment or rigidity... suggesting that the genes that contribute to autism segregate 
among relatives and have distinct influences on the different parts of the phenotype."

Cognitive Evidence for Fractionation

The major cognitive theories of autism each explain parts of the triad well, but no single theory 
can account for all three domains, suggesting they are underpinned by separate cognitive 
mechanisms.

● Theory of Mind Deficit: "...provides a good explanation for the pattern of social and 
communication difficulties in ASD... While an inability to represent mental states can 
account for social, communication and imagination impairments (Wing's original triad), it 
cannot explain the non-social dimensions of ASD, such as restricted and repetitive 
behavior."

● Executive Dysfunction: "...the perseveration, and planning and set-shifting difficulties 
seen in ASD resembled problems found in acquired frontal lesion patients... Thus, 
executive dysfunction does not appear to account for the full triad of symptoms in 
autism, although it does show selective and specific relationships with restricted and 
repetitive behaviors."

● Weak Central Coherence (Detail-Focused Processing): "...the central coherence 

account specifically limits its explanatory scope to the non-social assets and deficits of 
ASD (Happé and Frith 2006)."

● Empathizing-Systemizing Theory: "The use of two dimensions plotted orthogonally in 

Baron-Cohen's diagrams... suggests that systemizing and empathizing are 
conceptualized as independent in line with our suggestion of fractionable cognitive 
characteristics."

● Conclusion: "...we suggest that while satisfactory working theories exist for the various 

different aspects of autism, no one cognitive account to date can explain social, 
communication and non-social/RRBI patterns in ASD. The implication of our twin 
findings, indeed, would be that a unitary account is not needed and unlikely to be 
accurate."

CRITIQUE OF CURRENT ASSESSMENT & 
DIAGNOSTIC PRACTICES

The Circularity of Diagnosis-Based Research

The authors critique the methodological circularity of studying the co-occurrence of traits in a 
sample that was selected precisely because they exhibit all those traits. This challenges the 
validity of research used to support unitary diagnostic models.

● "The circularity involved in defining a sample and then finding differences in that sample 
which may be related to the definition of the sample has been an ongoing problem in this
area."

● "Individuals with zero, one, two, or three severe impairments can all be included, and 

how the impairments are correlated with each other can be measured."

Factor Analysis Shows Multiple Dimensions

A review of factor-analytic studies challenges the idea that a single "autism" factor can explain 
the symptom profile.

● "The authors concluded from a review of seven factor studies that met their criteria that 
all studies (but one) found evidence for multiple factors underlying autistic behaviors, 
and there was always a social impairment factor and a non-social factor."

● "This study presents important new evidence that the triad behaviors fall into three 
empirical factors, when studied as traits in a community sample of young adults."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 
(IMPLICATIONS FOR DIAGNOSIS & 
ASSESSMENT)

The authors argue that the "fractionable triad" model has significant implications for how autism 
should be diagnosed and conceptualized, moving away from a single category toward a multi-
dimensional profile.

Implications for Diagnosis

● "The question arises whether one should conceptualize autism and related disorders as 

lying on one spectrum, or whether each individual should be mapped in a three 
dimensional space along three, perhaps orthogonal, dimensions: social interaction, 
communication, and RRBIs."

● "Mapping individuals, or diagnostic subgroups, within a three dimension space would 

clarify, at least, the meaning of the currently vague 'PDD-NOS' label. In current DSM-IV 
criteria this can be applied to a child who shows all aspects of the triad but is sub-
threshold for full diagnosis of autism, or to a child who shows only one aspect of the 
triad. This compounds problems of heterogeneity in ASD, and renders the ‘PDD-NOS’ 
label largely uninformative."

● "Walker et al. (2004) reported that half of their group with PDD-NOS showed clinical-

level social and communication impairments but failed to meet autism criteria for RRBIS.
Such cases would surely be better labelled more specifically..."

Implications for Future Research (and Assessment)

● "A major implication of our twin results is that molecular genetic studies looking for 

susceptibility genes for autism may have more success finding genes associated with 
specific behaviors within autism than with autism as a whole."

● "Instead our approach would suggest genome-wide association studies of specific 
aspects of the ASD triad (e.g. social impairment-skill, or better still social insight as 
measured by cognitive tasks)."

● "One implication for research at the behavioral level is that care should be taken to 
assess each part of the triad separately, since global ratings of autism severity risk 
missing important information."

● "It will be vital to explore the nature of these children's difficulties in person and with 

cognitive assessments, in order to establish whether there are qualitative differences 
from ASD and what the clinical needs of such 'single deficit' children might be."
