Yes, using unexpected or atypical phrasing (i.e., "prediction error" in language) can
improve message recall by increasing attention, memory encoding, and learning,
though effects depend on context, individual differences, and the balance between
novelty and comprehensibility.

1. Introduction

Research across psycholinguistics, advertising, and cognitive neuroscience demonstrates that when language

violates expectations—through unexpected, novel, or atypical phrasing—it can enhance message recall and

learning. This effect, often described as a "prediction error," occurs because the brain is tuned to notice and

prioritize information that deviates from what is anticipated, leading to deeper processing and more robust

memory traces (Röer et al., 2021; Beard et al., 2022; Xu & Futrell, 2025; Fazekas et al., 2020; Quent et al., 2021;

Hodapp & Rabovsky, 2021; Boeltzig et al., 2024; Lyew et al., 2023; Hubbard et al., 2019; Ferreira & Chantavarin,

2018). The phenomenon is observed in diverse contexts, from serial recall tasks with semantic mismatches (Röer et

al., 2021), to creative advertising (Beard et al., 2022; Till & Baack, 2005; McQuarrie & Mick, 2003; Ang et al., 2007;

Jin et al., 2022), to language learning and comprehension (Fazekas et al., 2020; Quent et al., 2021; Hodapp &

Rabovsky, 2021; Hubbard et al., 2019; Höltje & Mecklinger, 2022). However, the benefits of surprise or prediction

error are moderated by factors such as cognitive control, age, and the meaningfulness of the unexpected content
(Zirnstein et al., 2018; Haeuser & Kray, 2024; Hubbard & Federmeier, 2024; Wlotko et al., 2012; Jongman et al.,

2022). This review synthesizes evidence on how and when prediction error in language improves message recall.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The search strategy involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8 thematic
clusters, focusing on prediction error, surprise, novelty, expectation violation, and memory in language processing,

advertising, and learning. In total, 1,032 papers were identified, 816 were screened, 515 were deemed eligible, and

the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Prediction Error and Memory: Core Experimental Evidence

•

•

•

•

Semantic mismatch and expectancy violation: Serial recall is more disrupted by background speech
containing unexpected (semantically mismatched) words, demonstrating that prediction error in language

captures attention and impacts memory across languages (Röer et al., 2021).

Surprise and learning: Both children and adults show greater learning and lasting change in linguistic
representations when exposed to surprising (less predictable) sentence structures, supporting error-based

learning theories (Fazekas et al., 2020).

Novelty and informativity: Less predictable but more informative words are prioritized in memory, receiving
more robust representation and resisting interference (Xu & Futrell, 2025; Quent et al., 2021).

Neural mechanisms: Event-related potentials (N400, P600) and brain imaging studies show that unexpected
words elicit stronger neural responses, which are linked to greater adaptation and implicit memory formation

(Aurnhammer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Frank et al., 2015; Fitz & Chang, 2019; Hodapp & Rabovsky, 2021).

2 / 9

3.2. Application in Advertising and Communication

•

•

•

Creative and metaphorical language: Ads using metaphors, creative phrasing, or rhetorical figures are more

memorable and produce "stickier" brand impressions than functional or conventional ads (Beard et al., 2022;
Alnajjar & Toivonen, 2020; Till & Baack, 2005; McQuarrie & Mick, 2003; Ang et al., 2007; Jin et al., 2022).

Novelty and recall: Novel and meaningful ads generate higher recall and more favorable attitudes than non-

novel ads; however, excessive novelty without meaning can impair attitudes (Ang et al., 2007).

Impairment effects: Creative ads can impair recall of regular ads shown alongside them, highlighting the

competitive advantage of unexpected phrasing in crowded environments (Jin et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2022).

3.3. Moderators and Boundary Conditions

•

•

•

Cognitive control and individual differences: The ability to benefit from prediction error in language depends

on cognitive control and language regulation abilities, especially in bilinguals and older adults (Zirnstein et al.,
2018; Haeuser & Kray, 2024; Hubbard & Federmeier, 2024; Wlotko et al., 2012; Jongman et al., 2022).

Age and context: Older adults may show reduced or altered neural responses to prediction error, and the

benefits of surprise can be less consistent with age (Haeuser & Kray, 2024; Hubbard & Federmeier, 2024;
Wlotko et al., 2012; Jongman et al., 2022).

Balance of novelty and meaning: Unexpected phrasing is most effective when it is also meaningful and

connected to the message; excessive unpredictability without relevance can reduce effectiveness (Ang et al.,
2007; Ferreira & Chantavarin, 2018).

3.4. False Memory and Lingering Predictions

•

•

False recognition: Highly predictable but unpresented words can linger in memory, leading to false recognition,

while unexpected words are more likely to be truly remembered (Haeuser & Kray, 2024; Hubbard et al., 2019;

Höltje & Mecklinger, 2022).

Memory updating: Prediction errors can lead to updating of conversational memories and social knowledge,

keeping representations current (Boeltzig et al., 2024).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports the idea that unexpected or atypical phrasing—creating a "prediction error"—can

enhance message recall by capturing attention, increasing processing depth, and triggering memory updating

(Röer et al., 2021; Beard et al., 2022; Xu & Futrell, 2025; Fazekas et al., 2020; Quent et al., 2021; Hodapp &

Rabovsky, 2021; Boeltzig et al., 2024; Lyew et al., 2023; Hubbard et al., 2019; Ferreira & Chantavarin, 2018). This

effect is robust across languages, age groups, and contexts, but is moderated by cognitive control, age, and the

meaningfulness of the unexpected content (Zirnstein et al., 2018; Haeuser & Kray, 2024; Hubbard & Federmeier,

2024; Ang et al., 2007; Wlotko et al., 2012; Jongman et al., 2022; Ferreira & Chantavarin, 2018). In advertising and
communication, creative and novel language not only improves recall but can also impair the memorability of

competing, conventional messages (Jin et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2022). However, excessive unpredictability without

relevance can reduce effectiveness or even lead to confusion (Ang et al., 2007; Ferreira & Chantavarin, 2018).

Neural evidence (N400, P600, fMRI) shows that prediction error in language is associated with increased neural

activity and subsequent memory adaptation (Aurnhammer et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Frank et al., 2015; Fitz &

Chang, 2019; Hodapp & Rabovsky, 2021). The balance between novelty and comprehensibility is crucial: the most

effective messages are both unexpected and meaningful (Ang et al., 2007; Ferreira & Chantavarin, 2018). There are

also costs, such as increased false memory for highly predictable but unpresented words (Haeuser & Kray, 2024;

Hubbard et al., 2019; Höltje & Mecklinger, 2022).

5. Conclusion

Unexpected or atypical phrasing—by creating prediction error—can significantly improve message recall,

especially when combined with meaningful content. This effect is robust but moderated by cognitive and
contextual factors, and is supported by both behavioral and neural evidence.
