DOCUMENT SUMMARY This 2021 study provides crucial evidence that autistic camouflaging 
is significantly higher in females, gender-diverse individuals, and those diagnosed in adulthood. 
It is the first study to directly and quantitatively link higher rates of camouflaging to a later age of
diagnosis. The authors introduce the critical concept of "performative" camouflaging 
(Compensation and Assimilation), suggesting these strategies go beyond simply hiding autistic 
traits to actively constructing a "non-autistic" persona that can mislead clinicians and delay 
diagnosis.

Camouflaging in autism spectrum disorder: Examining the roles of sex, 
gender identity and diagnostic timing

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper provides the direct scientific evidence for the central challenge our clients face: 
camouflaging. It validates the lived experiences of our key populations—women, gender-diverse
individuals, and late-diagnosed adults—by quantitatively demonstrating that they engage in 
significantly more camouflaging. The study's distinction between simply hiding traits ('Masking') 
and actively performing neurotypicality ('Compensation' and 'Assimilation') gives us a 
sophisticated, evidence-based language to discuss this with clients. Most importantly, this is the 
first study to prove a direct link between higher camouflaging and later diagnosis, confirming 
that camouflaging is a primary reason why traditional, observation-based assessments fail to 
identify so many of the people we serve.

Critical Findings: Who Camouflages and Why It Matters

Using the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q), this study examined 
camouflaging in 502 autistic adults and found significant differences based on sex, gender 
identity, and age of diagnosis.

● Females Camouflage More: Autistic individuals assigned female at birth reported 
significantly higher levels of camouflaging across all three subscales (Assimilation, 
Compensation, and Masking) compared to those assigned male at birth. This was true 
for both those diagnosed in childhood and those diagnosed in adulthood.

● Gender-Diverse Individuals Camouflage More: Gender-diverse autistic adults 

reported higher levels of 'Compensation' behaviors compared to cisgender autistic 
adults. The authors suggest individuals who are both neurodiverse and gender-diverse 
may be more susceptible to social pressures that contribute to camouflaging.

● Late-Diagnosed Individuals Camouflage More: This was the first study to directly 

compare these groups. Adults diagnosed at age 18 or older reported significantly higher 
levels of 'Assimilation' and 'Compensation' than those diagnosed as children or 
adolescents. This provides direct evidence that camouflaging is a factor in missed, mis-, 
and late diagnosis.

The "Performative" Nature of Camouflaging

The authors make a crucial distinction between different types of camouflaging, which helps 
explain why high-masking individuals are so often missed by clinicians.

● Masking: Involves monitoring and adjusting one's own behaviors (language, gestures, 
facial expressions) to hide autistic traits or "give away" one's autistic identity. This is 
about
 hiding who you are.

● Compensation & Assimilation: These are more "performative" and involve the "active, 

generative processes of constructing a non-autistic persona".

○ Compensation involves modeling the social behavior of others, such as by 

copying gestures, studying socially adept characters from media, and rehearsing 
facial expressions.

○ Assimilation involves strategies to blend in during social situations, such as 

"pretending to be normal". This is about
 performing who you are not.

● The authors speculate that while Masking conceals an autistic presentation,

 Compensation and Assimilation go further, "crafting a social presentation that 
not only conceals an ASD presentation but in fact argues against ASD". This active
performance may more strongly deter detection and interfere with the diagnostic 
process.

The High Cost of Camouflaging

The paper's introduction highlights the serious mental health consequences associated with 
camouflaging, providing a strong rationale for why identifying and supporting these individuals is
critical.

● Elevated camouflaging is associated with greater internalizing symptoms (like 

depression and anxiety) and suicidality.

● Later-diagnosed individuals report more mental health difficulties.
● Autistic women are at greater risk of completed suicide relative to autistic men, a 

reversal of the pattern in the general population.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the definition of camouflaging: It "generat[es] a mismatch between external 

observable features and the internal lived experience of ASD".

● On the link to late diagnosis: "Missed, mis- and late diagnosis in ASD, particularly for 
ASD females without co-occurring intellectual disability (ID), has been attributed in part 
to camouflaging".

● On the key finding for late diagnosis: "...we show for the first time in a direct between-

groups comparison of ASD adults diagnosed in childhood/adolescence versus 
adulthood, that adult-diagnosed individuals reported significantly more camouflaging 
behaviors".

● On why performative camouflaging is so effective at hiding autism: "...the active 

maintenance of a 'non-autistic' social self through Assimilation and Compensation may 
more strongly deter detection of this presentation as autistic and thus interfere with the 
referral of these individuals for diagnostic assessment".
