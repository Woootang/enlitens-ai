Yes, mindfulness practice induces neuroplasticity—structural and functional brain
changes—across multiple regions, supporting improvements in attention, emotion
regulation, and cognitive function.

1. Introduction

Mindfulness practice, encompassing meditation and related contemplative techniques, has been shown to induce

neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. This process underlies

improvements in attention, emotional regulation, and cognitive performance observed in both healthy individuals

and clinical populations. Evidence from randomized controlled trials, neuroimaging, and meta-analyses

demonstrates that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can lead to changes in brain structure (e.g., increased

cortical thickness, gray matter volume) and function (e.g., altered connectivity in key networks such as the default

mode, salience, and executive control networks) (Yue et al., 2023; Calderone et al., 2024; Gkintoni et al., 2025; Yu

et al., 2021; Lardone et al., 2018; Hölzel et al., 2011; Álvarez et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2020; Siew & Yu, 2023; Yang et

al., 2019; Taren et al., 2015; Gotink et al., 2016; Bremer et al., 2022; Sharp et al., 2018; Kral et al., 2019). However,

some large, well-controlled studies have reported null findings, highlighting the need for further research to clarify

the conditions and extent of mindfulness-induced neuroplasticity (Kral et al., 2022; Leow et al., 2023). Overall, the

literature supports a robust, though nuanced, relationship between mindfulness practice and neuroplastic changes.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic
Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search strategy targeted foundational theories, empirical studies,

neuroimaging, molecular markers, and meta-analyses on mindfulness and neuroplasticity. In total, 1037 papers

were identified, 706 were screened, 438 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included

in this review.

3. Results

3.1 Structural Brain Changes

Multiple studies and meta-analyses report that mindfulness practice increases cortical thickness and gray matter

volume in regions associated with attention, interoception, and emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex,

insula, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex (Calderone et al., 2024; Gkintoni et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2021;

Lardone et al., 2018; Hölzel et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2020; Siew & Yu, 2023; Yang et al., 2019; Taren et al., 2015;

Gotink et al., 2016; Sharp et al., 2018; Kral et al., 2019). These changes have been observed after both short-term

(weeks) and long-term (months to years) interventions, with some evidence for dose-dependent effects (Yu et al.,

2021; Tang et al., 2020; Siew & Yu, 2023; Yang et al., 2019; Gotink et al., 2016; Sharp et al., 2018). However, a large,

rigorously controlled study found no significant structural changes after an 8-week mindfulness-based stress

reduction (MBSR) program, suggesting that effects may depend on intervention length, intensity, or participant

characteristics (Kral et al., 2022).

3.2 Functional Connectivity and Network Reorganization

Mindfulness interventions enhance functional connectivity within and between large-scale brain networks,
including the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN) (Yue et

al., 2023; Álvarez et al., 2023; Taren et al., 2015; Gotink et al., 2016; Sezer et al., 2022; Bremer et al., 2022; Fam et
al., 2019; Sharp et al., 2018; Kral et al., 2019). These changes are associated with improved attention, emotion

regulation, and reduced stress and anxiety (Yue et al., 2023; Álvarez et al., 2023; Taren et al., 2015; Gotink et al.,
2016; Sezer et al., 2022; Bremer et al., 2022; Fam et al., 2019; Sharp et al., 2018; Kral et al., 2019). Increased

connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, for example, has been

linked to better attentional control and self-regulation (Taren et al., 2015; Kral et al., 2019).

3.3 Molecular and Electrophysiological Markers

Mindfulness practice is associated with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key
mediator of neuroplasticity, and changes in white matter microstructure (Tang et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020;

Gomutbutra et al., 2022; You & Ogawa, 2020; Sharp et al., 2018). Electrophysiological studies show alterations in

theta, alpha, and gamma oscillatory activity, reflecting enhanced cognitive control and sensory integration (Tang et

al., 2019; Dentico et al., 2016; Dziego et al., 2024; Berkovich-Ohana et al., 2012). These molecular and physiological
changes support the observed structural and functional brain adaptations.

3.4 Population and Practice-Type Differences

Neuroplastic effects of mindfulness have been observed in healthy adults, older adults with mild cognitive

impairment, and clinical populations (Yu et al., 2021; Leow et al., 2023; Siew & Yu, 2023; Fam et al., 2019). Different

mindfulness practices (e.g., focused attention, open monitoring, compassion meditation) produce distinct patterns
of neural change, suggesting specificity in how various techniques shape the brain (Singer & Engert, 2019;

Trautwein et al., 2020; Valk et al., 2017). Long-term practitioners show more pronounced and widespread

neuroplastic changes compared to novices (Lardone et al., 2018; Bashir et al., 2025; Guidotti et al., 2021; Savanth et
al., 2022; Valk et al., 2017).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports that mindfulness practice induces neuroplasticity, reflected in both structural and

functional brain changes (Yue et al., 2023; Calderone et al., 2024; Gkintoni et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2021; Lardone et

al., 2018; Hölzel et al., 2011; Álvarez et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2020; Siew & Yu, 2023; Yang et al., 2019; Taren et al.,

2015; Gotink et al., 2016; Bremer et al., 2022; Sharp et al., 2018; Kral et al., 2019). These adaptations are linked to

improvements in attention, emotion regulation, and cognitive function, and are observed across diverse

populations and mindfulness techniques (Calderone et al., 2024; Gkintoni et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2021; Lardone et al.,
2018; Hölzel et al., 2011; Álvarez et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2020; Siew & Yu, 2023; Yang et al., 2019; Taren et al., 2015;

Gotink et al., 2016; Bremer et al., 2022; Sharp et al., 2018; Kral et al., 2019). However, the magnitude and

consistency of these effects vary, with some studies—especially those with rigorous controls—reporting null

findings (Kral et al., 2022; Leow et al., 2023). Factors such as intervention duration, intensity, participant

characteristics, and measurement sensitivity likely influence outcomes (Kral et al., 2022; Leow et al., 2023; Siew &

Yu, 2023; Yang et al., 2019; Gotink et al., 2016; Sharp et al., 2018). The specificity of neuroplastic changes to

different mindfulness practices and populations highlights the need for tailored interventions and further research
into underlying mechanisms (Singer & Engert, 2019; Trautwein et al., 2020; Valk et al., 2017).

5. Conclusion

Mindfulness practice reliably induces neuroplasticity, with structural and functional brain changes supporting
improvements in cognition and emotion. However, the extent and consistency of these effects depend on practice

type, duration, and individual factors. Ongoing research is clarifying the mechanisms and optimizing interventions

for diverse populations.

5.1 Research Gaps

Key gaps include the need for larger, longer-term RCTs, better control conditions, and mechanistic studies linking
