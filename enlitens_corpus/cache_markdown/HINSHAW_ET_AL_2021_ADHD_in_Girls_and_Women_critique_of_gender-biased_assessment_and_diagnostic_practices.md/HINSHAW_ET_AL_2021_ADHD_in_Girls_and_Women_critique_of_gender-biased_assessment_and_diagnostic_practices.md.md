DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This annual research review by Hinshaw et al. provides a comprehensive overview of how 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) manifests in girls and women, arguing that they 
have been historically underrepresented and misdiagnosed. The paper is centrally important to 
Enlitens as it serves as a powerful case study for how standardized, male-prototype-based 
assessment models fail entire populations. It provides extensive evidence that diagnostic criteria
and observer ratings are biased, leading clinicians to overlook the predominantly inattentive and
internalizing presentations common in females, who often use compensatory strategies to mask
their impairments. This failure of standard assessment leads to severe, life-threatening 
outcomes, including a high risk for self-harm, underscoring the urgent need for a more nuanced,
developmentally-informed, and gender-aware clinical assessment model like the one Enlitens 
proposes.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Until recently, however, almost all research in this area has focused on boys and men. 

Female presentations have been largely overlooked in both clinical and research 
settings."

● "Clinicians may overlook symptoms and impairments in females because of less overt 
(but still impairing) symptom manifestations in girls and women and their frequent 
adoption of compensatory strategies."

● "Symptom lists for ADHD are biased toward male behaviors (e.g., physical overactivity 
or extreme risk-taking) as opposed to female-related manifestations (e.g., excessive 
verbalizations or more subtle indicators of impulsivity...)."

● "Teachers rate boys as higher on both [inattention and hyperactivity], with the clear 

implication that adult ratings may lead to underreporting and underdiagnosis of ADHD in 
girls."

● "A 15-minute office visit without normed informant rating scales, developmental histories,

medical examinations, or testing to consider comorbid psychiatric and learning 
conditions may lead to both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, with the former more 
likely for boys but the latter for girls."

● "The assumption that girls and women simply do not exhibit ADHD or do so only rarely is

no longer tenable."

CRITIQUE OF CURRENT ASSESSMENT & 
DIAGNOSTIC PRACTICES

Reasons for the Underrepresentation and Misdiagnosis of Females

The authors provide a detailed list of factors contributing to the failure to identify ADHD in girls 
and women, highlighting systemic biases in research, clinical practice, and assessment tools.

● Historical Neglect: "long-term scientific/professional insistence that the condition was 
vanishingly rare in girls (and even more so in women, as ADHD was assumed to be 
childhood-limited)"

● Symptom Presentation Mismatch: "predominance of the inattentive (and less visibly 

impairing) presentation in females"

● Lower Comorbid Externalizing Behaviors: "lower rates of co-occurring disruptive 

behavior disorders in girls or later onset of such... suppressing the visibility and salience 
of female symptoms"

● Clinician Bias: "clinician bias that ADHD symptoms are indicative of the diagnosis in 

boys but not girls"

● Biased Informant Ratings: "the finding that parent and teacher ratings systematically 

underreport female, as opposed to male, ADHD behavior patterns, even when 
objectively observed behaviors are matched between the sexes"

● Compensatory Strategies / Masking: "higher rates of compensatory behaviors in 

females" and "many girls with actual ADHD may be hard to identify given their tendency 
to present with exclusive inattention, relative lack of externalizing behaviors, comorbid 
presence of anxiety and/or depression, and use of compensatory strategies and family 
supports that may mask core symptoms"

Failure of Typical Diagnostic Practices

The paper critiques the gap between evidence-based assessment guidelines and real-world 
clinical practice, which particularly disadvantages females.

● "Despite evidence-based guidelines... general pediatricians and adult practitioners are 
often not sufficiently trained in (or reimbursed for, in the United States) such evidence-
based assessments."

● "A 15-minute office visit without normed informant rating scales, developmental histories,

medical examinations, or testing to consider comorbid psychiatric and learning 

conditions may lead to both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, with the former more 
likely for boys but the latter for girls..."

The Problem with Sex-Specific Norms

The authors caution against simply creating separate, lower diagnostic bars for females, arguing
instead for fundamentally better, more inclusive assessment methods.

● "...a core issue is whether girls and women should be diagnosed in relation to overall 
norms (emanating from both males and females) versus female-specific norms."
● "With the latter, girls would more easily meet symptom thresholds, as they would be 

compared with the ‘lower bar’ of average female levels of ADHD symptoms..."

● "Yet we urge caution. It would need to be definitively established that girls qualifying for 
an ADHD diagnosis... on the basis of sex-specific norms reveal clear impairments. 
Otherwise, rates of diagnosis in females with ADHD could become overinflated."
● "In the absence of such evidence, it may be preferable to ensure that (a) diagnostic 
items reflect both male and female-specific manifestations, (b) subtle indicators of 
inattention/disorganization are probed, and (c) clinicians inquire about such factors as 
compensatory behaviors and life transitions in girls and women..."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The 'Gender Paradox'

This theory attempts to explain why a condition with lower prevalence in one sex may present 
more severely in that sex.

● "According to the 'gender paradox'... the sex with lower prevalence is expected to 
display more severe features as well as higher rates of comorbid disorders."

● Polygenetic multiple threshold model: "...the lower-prevalence sex (e.g., females with
ADHD) would need to have greater levels of family history and a higher genetic 'load' 
and/or environmental disadvantage to meet diagnostic criteria."

● Constitutional variability model: "...boys are slower to mature than girls, leading to a 
greater propensity for exhibiting a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental symptoms. 
Given the extreme gender atypicality of her symptoms in relation to other females, a girl 
with significant ADHD would thus be likely to have demonstrable neural dysfunction."

Heterotypic Continuity

This concept explains how an underlying vulnerability can manifest as different symptoms or 
disorders over time, arguing against static, cross-sectional assessment.

● "Finally, what appears to be the sequential presence of different categorical diagnoses 
for example, from early ADHD to later conduct disorder, followed by substance use 
disorders and adult antisocial personality disorder for males and self-harmful behaviors 
and adult borderline personality disorder for females... may actually reflect heterotypic 
continuity."

● "This concept denotes the stability of an underlying predisposition that yields changing 
symptoms across development as the result of a range of biological and contextual 
forces."

● "In short, for substantial numbers of girls with ADHD, a heterotypically continuous 

trajectory from early impulsivity (and in some cases, high levels of concurrent early 
inattention) is salient."

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS 
(FEMALES WITH ADHD)

Symptom Presentation

● "Girls and women with ADHD show a predominance of inattention and associated 

internalizing problems; boys and men display greater levels of hyperactive-impulsive 
symptoms and associated externalizing problems."

● "Females are more likely to present inattention symptoms and associated internalizing 
problems, whereas males are more likely to display hyperactive-impulsive symptoms 
and associated externalizing problems."

Key Impairments and Long-Term Risks

● General: "Females with ADHD experience, on average, serious impairments, with a 

particularly heightened risk for problems in close relationships and engagement in self-
harm."

● Self-Harm & Suicidality:

○ In one longitudinal study (BGALS), girls with childhood ADHD-Combined 

presentation had markedly higher rates of attempted suicide (22% vs. 6% of 
comparisons) and moderate-to-severe NSSI (51% vs. 19% of comparisons) by 
early adulthood.

○ The combination of childhood ADHD and one or more forms of maltreatment was

linked to a suicide attempt rate of over 33%.

● Unplanned Pregnancy: The BGALS study found unplanned pregnancy rates of 43% in 

the ADHD sample versus 11% of comparisons.

● Intimate Partner Violence (IPV): The BGALS study found a high risk for intimate 

partner violence among women with childhood ADHD.

● Academic & Employment:

○ The BGALS sample showed academic underperformance, especially in 

mathematics.

○ A Norwegian study found a larger incidence of lifetime work-related disability in 
females with ADHD, with inattentive symptoms being especially predictive.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 
(RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
ASSESSMENT)

The authors provide a detailed list of recommended practices for the evaluation of ADHD in 
females, which strongly aligns with the principles of a clinical interview model.

Regarding evaluation and assessment:

● "The assumption that girls and women simply do not exhibit ADHD or do so only rarely is

no longer tenable."

● "A thorough, evidence-based evaluation is essential, including assessment of comorbid 

behavioral, emotional, and learning issues."

● "Many assessment scales laden are with items emphasizing male forms of ADHD but do
not focus sufficiently on potential female-relevant behaviors (e.g., hyper-verbal behavior 
versus overly active physical behavior)."

● "Many girls with actual ADHD may be hard to identify given their tendency to present 

with exclusive inattention, relative lack of externalizing behaviors, comorbid presence of 
anxiety and/or depression, and use of compensatory strategies and family supports that 
may mask core symptoms..."

● "Times of life transition... may well be triggering of symptom exacerbation. Thus, 

developmental histories are essential."

● "Evaluation of strengths in the assessment process is crucial, as their elucidation may be

important targets for treatment planning."
