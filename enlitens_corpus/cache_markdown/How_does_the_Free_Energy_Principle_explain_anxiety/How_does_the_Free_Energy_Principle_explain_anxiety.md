How the Free Energy Principle Explains Anxiety and Depression from a First-
Principles Perspective

1. Introduction

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory in neuroscience that posits all self-organizing biological

systems—including the human brain—act to minimize "free energy," a formal measure of surprise or uncertainty

about sensory inputs. When applied to mental health, the FEP provides a first-principles account of how anxiety

and depression can arise from the brain’s attempts to predict and control its environment. In this framework,

anxiety is conceptualized as a state of learned uncertainty, where persistent unpredictability leads the brain to

expect ongoing uncertainty, while depression is seen as an adaptive response to anticipated negative or

uncontrollable outcomes, resulting in pessimistic beliefs and reduced motivation. These models offer a

mechanistic, computational explanation for the development and persistence of these disorders, integrating

cognitive, affective, and neurobiological levels of analysis (McGovern et al., 2022; McGovern et al., 2021; Badcock

et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2017; Chekroud, 2015; Yanagisawa et al., 2022; Kiverstein et al., 2020;

Joffily & Coricelli, 2013; Krupnik, 2024).

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search strategy included 20 targeted queries across 8 thematic groups,

focusing on the Free Energy Principle, active inference, predictive coding, and their application to anxiety and

depression. In total, 965 papers were identified, 412 were screened, 152 were deemed eligible, and the 20 most

relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. The Free Energy Principle: Core Concepts

•

•

The FEP posits that biological agents must minimize free energy (a proxy for surprise or prediction error) to

maintain their existence and resist disorder (McGovern et al., 2022; Clark et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2017;

Chekroud, 2015; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013).

The brain achieves this by building generative models that predict sensory inputs and updating these models to

reduce discrepancies between predictions and reality (prediction errors) (Clark et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2017;

Chekroud, 2015; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013; Krupnik, 2024).

3.2. Anxiety as Learned Uncertainty

•

•

•

Anxiety is formalized as a state of learned uncertainty: when an organism repeatedly encounters

unpredictable or uncontrollable situations, its generative model comes to expect uncertainty in the future, even

if the environment changes (McGovern et al., 2022; McGovern et al., 2021; Clark et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2017).

This persistent expectation of uncertainty leads to hypervigilance, excessive worry, and difficulty in controlling

apprehension—core features of anxiety disorders (McGovern et al., 2022; McGovern et al., 2021; Clark et al.,

2018; Peters et al., 2017).

The FEP explains the cyclical nature of anxiety: anticipation of anxiety in certain contexts leads to avoidance or
heightened arousal, reinforcing the expectation of uncertainty (McGovern et al., 2022; McGovern et al., 2021;

Clark et al., 2018).

3.3. Depression as Adaptive Response to Negative Predictions

•

•

•

•

Depression is conceptualized as an adaptive response to anticipated negative or uncontrollable outcomes,

especially in social or interpersonal contexts (Badcock et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018; Chekroud, 2015; Kiverstein

et al., 2020).

The brain’s generative model, shaped by past experiences of uncontrollable stress or social exclusion, predicts

that future actions are unlikely to yield positive or predictable outcomes (Badcock et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018;

Chekroud, 2015; Kiverstein et al., 2020).

This results in pessimistic beliefs, reduced motivation, and withdrawal—hallmarks of depressive states

(Badcock et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018; Chekroud, 2015; Kiverstein et al., 2020).

The FEP also accounts for the slow remission of depressive symptoms: updating deeply ingrained negative
beliefs (priors) takes time and repeated positive experiences (Chekroud, 2015).

3.4. Emotional Valence and Mood

•

•

Emotional valence (positive or negative feelings) is linked to the rate of change of free energy: decreasing free

energy is associated with positive emotions, while increasing free energy signals negative emotions

(Yanagisawa et al., 2022; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013).

Mood can be seen as a higher-order prior over uncertainty, tuning the brain’s expectations about the

predictability of the environment and influencing emotional responses (Clark et al., 2018; Kiverstein et al., 2020;

Joffily & Coricelli, 2013).

4. Discussion

The Free Energy Principle offers a mechanistic, first-principles account of anxiety and depression by framing

them as maladaptive outcomes of the brain’s attempts to minimize uncertainty and surprise. In anxiety, the brain’s

generative model becomes biased toward expecting uncertainty, leading to persistent apprehension and

hypervigilance (McGovern et al., 2022; McGovern et al., 2021; Clark et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2017). In depression,

the model predicts that actions are unlikely to yield positive or controllable outcomes, resulting in withdrawal and

pessimism (Badcock et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018; Chekroud, 2015; Kiverstein et al., 2020). This approach unifies
cognitive, affective, and neurobiological perspectives, and aligns with clinical observations such as the slow

remission of depressive symptoms and the cyclical nature of anxiety (McGovern et al., 2022; Badcock et al., 2017;

Clark et al., 2018; Chekroud, 2015; Kiverstein et al., 2020; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013).

The FEP also provides a framework for understanding emotional valence and mood as emergent properties of the

brain’s ongoing efforts to minimize free energy (Yanagisawa et al., 2022; Joffily & Coricelli, 2013). However,

empirical validation of these models remains a challenge, and more research is needed to translate these

computational insights into clinical interventions (McGovern et al., 2022; Badcock et al., 2017; Chekroud, 2015;

Joffily & Coricelli, 2013; Krupnik, 2024).
