DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper by Vittorio Gallese and George Lakoff presents the theory of "embodied cognition," a
powerful scientific framework that directly supports Enlitens' mission. It argues that all concepts, 
from the concrete "grasp" to the most abstract, are not disembodied symbols but are 
fundamentally grounded in the brain's sensory-motor system. The authors dismantle the "first-
generation cognitive science" view that underpins standardized testing—the idea of an abstract,
universal "language of thought"—by showing how understanding is a form of embodied 
simulation, using the same neural circuitry as perception and action.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"A common philosophical position is that all concepts even concepts about action and 
perception are symbolic and abstract, and therefore must be implemented outside the brain's 
sensory-motor system. We will argue against this position..."

"First-generation cognitive science was strongly influenced by the analytic tradition of 
philosophy of language, from which it inherited the propensity to analyse concepts on the basis 
of formal abstract models, totally unrelated to the life of the body, and of the brain regions 
governing the body's functioning in the world."

"We will propose a radically different view. We will argue that conceptual knowledge is 
embodied, that is, it is mapped within our sensory-motor system."

"We will argue that the sensory-motor system not only provides structure to conceptual content, 
but also characterises the semantic content of concepts in terms of the way that we function 
with our bodies in the world."

"The same neural substrate used in imagining is used in understanding."

"If you can't imagine picking up a glass or seeing someone picking up a glass, then you can't 
understand that sentence."

"Our hypothesis develops this fact one step further. It says that understanding is imagination, 
and that what you understand of a sentence in a context is the meaning of that sentence in that 
context."

"Our proposal is not an internalist theory of meaning. The reason is that imagination, like 
perceiving and doing, is embodied, that is, structured by our constant encounter and interaction 
with the world via our bodies and brains. The result is an interactionist theory of meaning."

"Accordingly, we will argue that a key aspect of human cognition is neural exploitation the 
adaptation of sensory-motor brain mechanisms to serve new roles in reason and language, 
while retaining their original functions as well."

"If this is true, it follows that there is no single 'module' for language and that human language 
makes use of mechanisms also present in nonhuman primates."

"Schemas are therefore not purely internal, nor are they purely representations of external 
reality."

"Language makes direct use of the same brain structures used in perception and action."

"There is no such thing as a 'language module'."

"Neither semantics nor grammar is symbolic, in the sense of the theory of formal systems, which
consists of rules for manipulating disembodied meaningless symbols."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Disembodied View (Critique of First-Generation Cognitive Science)

Gallese and Lakoff define and critique the traditional view of concepts that dominated early 
cognitive science. This view, heavily influenced by philosophers like Fodor, holds that concepts 
are:

● Abstract, Amodal, and Arbitrary: Concepts are seen as fundamentally different from 

sensory or motor information. They are not tied to any specific sensory modality (vision, 
touch, etc.).

● Symbolic: Concepts are represented in a "language of thought," made up of abstract 

symbols that are manipulated by formal, syntactic rules, much like a computer program.

● Separate from the Sensory-Motor System: This theory posits a sharp dividing line 
between the brain's "modular" input/output systems (perception and action) and a 

central, generalized cognitive system where thinking occurs. Meaning is referential, 
based on a correspondence between the abstract symbols and things in the external 
world.
Gallese and Lakoff argue that this entire framework is inconsistent with modern 
neuroscientific evidence, which shows that the sensory-motor system is directly involved
in conceptual understanding. They also argue it is biologically implausible, as it would 
require the brain to completely duplicate the complex structures found in the sensory-
motor system elsewhere for abstract thought, a violation of Occam's Razor.

The Embodied View (The Authors' Proposal)

The central argument of the paper is that conceptual knowledge is embodied. This means:

● Concepts are Mapped in the Sensory-Motor System: Conceptual knowledge is not in 
a separate "cognition module" but is physically grounded in the same brain regions used
for perception, action, and imagination.

● Meaning is Interactional: Concepts get their meaning from the way we function and 

interact with the world through our bodies and brains. Meaning is not a pure reflection of 
external reality, nor is it purely internal; it arises from the interaction between our bodies 
and our environment.

● Understanding is Simulation: The mechanism for understanding a concept is to 

perform a mental simulation of the relevant perceptions or actions. For example, to 
understand "Harry picked up the glass," you simulate the experience of seeing or 
performing that action. This simulation uses the same neural substrate as actually acting
or perceiving.

Multimodality (vs. Supramodality)

The authors reject the idea of strict brain modularity in favor of multimodality.

● Supramodality is the traditional view, consistent with modularity. It assumes that distinct
modalities (vision, motor control, etc.) are processed in separate brain areas and then 
integrated later in "association areas" that are outside the sensory-motor system.

● Multimodality is the authors' view. It states that modalities are integrated at the level of 

the sensory-motor system itself. The same neurons and functional clusters are 
inherently multimodal, responding to and integrating information from multiple sources 
(e.g., a single premotor neuron firing for both seeing a graspable object and performing 
the grasp). This means there are no separate modules for action and perception that 
need to be associated later.

Neural Exploitation: Conceptual Metaphor and Cogs

The theory explains how abstract concepts are also grounded in the sensory-motor system 
through "neural exploitation"—the adaptation of sensory-motor brain mechanisms for new roles 
in reason and language.

● Conceptual Metaphor: Abstract concepts are understood by metaphorically mapping 
them onto concrete, sensory-motor domains. For example, the abstract concept of 
LOVE is understood via the sensory-motor experience of A JOURNEY (e.g., "our 
relationship is at a crossroads"). Neural models show that the same circuits that control 

physical actions can be used in simulation to perform the abstract inferences required by
the metaphor.

● The Theory of Cogs: The authors propose that the concepts that make up grammar 
(like aspect, causation, containment) are "cogs"—abstract schemas that run on the 
circuitry of the premotor cortex and other "secondary" sensory-motor areas. These 
circuits normally choreograph physical actions, but their connections to the primary 
motor cortex can be inhibited, allowing them to run in simulation to perform abstract 
reasoning.

KEY EVIDENCE & METHODOLOGY

Simulation Hypothesis

The core evidence for the theory comes from the concept of simulation, which is supported by 
two main lines of neuroscientific research:

1. Mental Imagery:

○ Embodied Visual Imagery: Brain imaging shows that imagining seeing 

something activates some of the same brain regions, including the primary visual
cortex, as actually seeing it.

○ Embodied Motor Imagery: Imagining performing an action activates a common 

network of motor centers (premotor cortex, cerebellum, etc.) as actually 
performing the action. The body even responds physiologically (heartbeat, 
breathing) to imagined effort as it would to real effort. Mentally rehearsing an 
exercise can even produce strength gains comparable to real exercise.

2. Multimodal Neurons (The Mirror Neuron System):

○ Canonical Neurons: These neurons, found in the premotor cortex, fire both 

when an individual performs an action (like grasping) and when they simply see 
an object that affords that action (e.g., seeing a small object activates neurons for
a "precision grip"). The authors argue this is evidence of an automatic simulation 
of the potential action.

○ Mirror Neurons: These neurons fire both when an individual performs a goal-
directed action and when they observe another individual performing a similar 
action. They also fire when an action is inferred but not fully seen (e.g., a hand 
reaching behind a screen to grasp an object) or when only the sound of the 
action is heard. The authors argue this demonstrates that observing or hearing 
an action triggers an internal simulation of that action in the observer.

Basic-Level Categories

The theory is also supported by evidence from cognitive science on "basic-level categories" 
(e.g., "chair" is basic, while "furniture" is superordinate and "rocking chair" is subordinate). The 
basic level is cognitively special because it is the highest level at which:

● We can form a mental image of a category member.
● We have generalized motor programs for interacting with category members.
● We achieve gestalt perception.

This shows that categorization is not based on objective properties of the world alone 

but is "embodied"—shaped by our bodily interactions, motor programs, and perceptual 
systems.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Predictions for Empirical Validation

The authors propose several testable experiments to validate their embodied theory of 
concepts, particularly for abstract and metaphorical thought:

● fMRI Studies of Metaphor: When a person understands a metaphorical sentence like 

"He grasped the idea," their brain's sensory-motor regions for the physical act of 
grasping should become active. Similarly, understanding "They
 kicked him out of class" should activate the foot/leg areas of the motor and premotor 
cortices.

● Action-Sentence Compatibility for Metaphors: Building on existing research showing 
that performing an action can interfere with or facilitate understanding a sentence about 
a similar literal action, the authors predict the same effect for metaphors. For example, 
having a subject physically exert force while reading a sentence with a metaphorical use 
of a force-related verb (e.g., "She
 pushed the committee to accept the proposal") should affect comprehension time, 
depending on whether the physical action is compatible with the metaphorical one.

Implications for Understanding Cognition and Language

The paper concludes with a list of the radical implications of the embodied cognition framework:

● Language is Not a Separate Module: Language is not a self-contained module but 

directly uses the brain's general-purpose structures for perception and action.

● Thought is Not Disembodied: Rational thought is not a purely abstract, logical process 

but is an "exploitation" of the normal sensory-motor operations of our bodies.

● Grammar is Conceptual: The hierarchical structure of grammar is the hierarchical 

structure of embodied concepts (schemas). Grammar is the set of neural connections 
between conceptual schemas and phonological schemas.

● Semantics is Not Symbolic: Meaning is not derived from rules for manipulating 

meaningless symbols. Both semantics and grammar are inherently multimodal and 
grounded in the sensory-motor system.
