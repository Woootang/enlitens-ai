DOCUMENT SUMMARY This study provides critical evidence for the Enlitens model by 
demonstrating that women who self-define their childbirth as traumatic can experience 
significant post-traumatic growth (PTG), not just pathology. It identifies "deliberate rumination"—
the intentional process of reflecting on an experience to find meaning—as the key mechanism 
that transforms distressing intrusive thoughts into personal strength, new possibilities, and 
deeper relationships. This research offers a scientific framework for our strengths-based, 
trauma-informed approach, validating that adaptive processes can lead to positive change after 
trauma and providing concrete, non-pathologizing intervention strategies like guided reflection 
and expressive writing.

Posttraumatic Growth in Women After a 
Childbirth Experience: The Influence of 
Individual Characteristics and Intrusive 
and Deliberate Rumination

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is a cornerstone for our work on trauma. It scientifically validates the concept of 
Post-traumatic Growth (PTG) in a population often viewed exclusively through a lens of 
pathology (e.g., postpartum depression, PTSD). It provides a specific, teachable cognitive 
mechanism—deliberate rumination—that helps individuals move from intrusive, distressing 
thoughts toward finding meaning and strength. This perfectly aligns with our mission to 
understand the adaptation, not just the "disorder," and to provide tools that foster resilience.

Crucially, the study's inclusion criteria—"women who had a self-defined traumatic childbirth 
experience"—respects lived experience over external diagnostic checklists. This validates our 
client-centered approach. The finding that intrusive thoughts can be a precursor to growth 
reframes a core "symptom" of trauma as a potential starting point for healing, not just something
to be suppressed. This research provides a powerful, evidence-based framework for explaining 
how challenging experiences can lead to profound positive change, directly supporting the 
Enlitens philosophy.

Critical Statistics for Our Work

Prevalence and Demographics

● Prevalence of Traumatic Childbirth: Between 9% and 50% of women report their 

childbirth experience as a traumatic event.

● Sample: 202 women who self-identified their childbirth experience as traumatic 

participated in the study.

● Age: Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 46, with a mean age of 33.68 (SD = 4.70).
● Education: A high percentage of the sample was highly educated, with 80.2% having a 

bachelor's degree or more.

● Marital Status: 93% were married or living with a partner.
● Employment: 84.2% were employed.

Obstetric and Trauma-Related Details

● Parity: Most women were first-time mothers (primiparas, 66.3%).
● Pregnancy Planning: 76.7% had a planned pregnancy.
● Type of Delivery:

○ Vaginal delivery with forceps or vacuum: 51%. (Note: Source 810 shows 58.9% 

for this category, a discrepancy exists in the paper).

○ Cesarean birth: 37.6%. (Note: Source 810 shows 29.7% for this category).
○ Vaginal delivery: 11.4%.

● Self-Reported Type of Trauma:

○ Related to delivery problems (e.g., perineal trauma, use of forceps): 63.9%.
○ Related to experiencing loss of control during labor: 22.2%.
○ Related to infant conditions (e.g., health problems, prematurity): 13.9%.
● Link Between Planned Pregnancy & Rumination: Women with a planned pregnancy 

had significantly higher levels of deliberate rumination compared to those with an 
unplanned pregnancy.

Key Findings on Rumination and PTG

● Intrusive vs. Deliberate Rumination: Intrusive and deliberate rumination were 
positively associated with all five dimensions of Post-traumatic Growth (PTG).

● Mediation Model:

○ Full Mediation: Deliberate rumination fully explained the relationship between 

intrusive rumination and the PTG dimensions of:

■ Relating to others.
■ New opportunities.
■ Personal strength.

○ Partial Mediation: Deliberate rumination partially explained the relationship 

between intrusive rumination and the PTG dimensions of:

■ Spiritual changes.
■ Appreciation of life.

○ This means that the initial, unwanted distressing thoughts (intrusive rumination) 
led to growth primarily because they triggered a more purposeful, meaning-
making thought process (deliberate rumination).

Methodology We Can Learn From

● Self-Identification of Trauma: The study's primary inclusion criterion was that women 
"self-identified as having experienced a traumatic childbirth event". This is a 
powerful, client-centered approach that validates subjective experience over objective, 
event-based checklists. It respects that trauma is defined by the individual's emotional 
response, not a specific set of circumstances.

● Differentiating Rumination: The use of the Event Related Rumination Inventory 

(ERRI) is a valuable methodological choice. It separates automatic, unwanted thoughts 
(intrusive rumination) from intentional, reflective thinking (deliberate rumination). This 
distinction is key to understanding how a person can move from distress to growth.

● Measuring Growth: The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) was used to 

measure positive changes across five domains: relating to others, new possibilities, 
personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life. This provides a 
multidimensional framework for understanding positive adaptation after trauma.

● Mediation Analysis: The study used a statistical model (PROCESS macro for Model 4) 
to explicitly test whether deliberate rumination acts as the bridge between intrusive 
rumination and PTG. This provides a statistical basis for the therapeutic process we aim 
to facilitate.

Findings That Challenge the System

This research directly confronts a pathology-focused view of trauma.

● Growth is a Possible Outcome of Trauma: The study is built on the premise that 

individuals who experience traumatic events may also experience positive psychological 
changes, or PTG. This challenges the dominant narrative that trauma leads only to 
negative outcomes like PTSD and depression.

● Trauma is Subjective, Not Objective: The definition of traumatic childbirth is centered 

on the woman's experience: "interactions and/or occurrences... that caused 
overwhelming emotions and distressing responses". It acknowledges that a lack of social
support from providers and a loss of control are key factors, not just medical 
emergencies.

● Intrusive Thoughts Can Be Adaptive: The study's model suggests intrusive rumination
is a necessary precursor to growth. "Intrusive rumination is essential to engaging in 
deliberate rumination" and "intrusive thoughts have the potential to stimulate more 
intentional cognitive processing". This reframes a primary "symptom" of PTSD as the 
potential start of a meaning-making journey, rather than just a sign of pathology.

● A Mismatch in Expectations Causes Trauma: The paper highlights that a key cause 

of trauma is "a discrepancy between a woman's expectations and her actual 
experiences". This points directly to how the medical system itself, through unexpected 
interventions or deviations from a birth plan, can be the source of trauma, a concept 
central to iatrogenic harm.

Populations Discussed

● The study focuses on women who have had a self-defined traumatic childbirth 

experience.

● The participants were recruited from the North of Portugal and were predominantly 

Portuguese (95%), married, employed, and highly educated.

● The authors acknowledge that using a web-based survey may have created a sampling 

bias by excluding women experiencing "digital poverty".

Alternative Approaches Mentioned

The paper champions cognitive and psychosocial approaches over purely medical or 
pathologizing models.

● Deliberate Rumination as a Therapeutic Target: This is the core alternative approach.

It is an "intentional process of thinking and reflecting to understand the cause and 
meaning of an event". This is an active, agentic process that can be taught and 
supported.

● Expressive Writing/Journaling: The paper explicitly links deliberate rumination to 
practices like "journaling or expressive writing, which promote self-distancing and 
facilitate the process of making meaning". This offers a concrete, low-cost, accessible 
intervention strategy.

● Facilitated Discussion: The authors suggest developing psychosocial interventions 

that provide "opportunities for women to discuss the birth with professionals or peers". 
This emphasizes the role of social support and verbal processing in fostering deliberate 
rumination.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the definition of PTG: "PTG is the experience of positive change that occurs as a 

result of coping with highly challenging life crises."

● On the definition of traumatic childbirth: A "woman's experience of interactions 

and/or occurrences directly related to childbirth that caused overwhelming emotions and 
distressing responses; leading to short- and/or long-term negative impacts on a woman's
health and well-being."

● On reframing intrusive thoughts: "Some authors consider that intrusive rumination is 
essential to engaging in deliberate rumination... since intrusive thoughts have the 
potential to stimulate more intentional cognitive processing."

● On the process of growth: "Intrusive rumination can be a precursor of deliberate 

rumination, which in turn can contribute to PTG."

● On the power of deliberate thought: "Deliberate rumination seems to be an important 

factor in facilitating PTG."

● On a call for new interventions: "These findings could help develop psychosocial 
interventions to maximize opportunities for deliberate rumination for women with 
traumatic childbirth experiences."

● On the importance of meaning-making: "Deliberate rumination can be associated with
higher levels of PTG, as it evidences that the individual could carry out an ongoing 
process of constructing meaning and reconstructing representations of their social world 
after the traumatic event."

Clinical Implications

This study provides a clear roadmap for supporting individuals who have experienced trauma, 
which aligns perfectly with the Enlitens model.

1. Validate Subjective Experience: The first step is to honor the client's self-definition of 

an experience as traumatic, regardless of "objective" severity.

2. Normalize and Reframe Intrusive Thoughts: Instead of treating intrusive thoughts 

solely as a symptom to be eliminated, they can be framed as the mind's initial, automatic
attempt to grapple with a difficult event, and as a signal that deeper processing is 
needed.

3. Actively Facilitate Deliberate Rumination: The core clinical intervention is to guide the

client from intrusive to deliberate rumination. This can be done by:

○ Encouraging expressive writing or journaling about their experiences.
○ Providing structured opportunities to talk through the experience with a 

professional or in a peer-support setting.

○ Asking questions that promote meaning-making and reflection on changes in 

perspective, values, and personal strength.

4. Be Person-Centered: The authors caution that this process of deep reflection "might be

too burdensome for certain women" and that approaches "may not be universally 
effective". Interventions must be paced according to the individual's capacity and 
resources.
