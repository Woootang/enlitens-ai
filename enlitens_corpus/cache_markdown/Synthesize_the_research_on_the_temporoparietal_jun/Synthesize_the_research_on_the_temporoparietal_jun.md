The Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) and Its Role in Perspective-Taking During
Persuasive Communication

1. Introduction

The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a critical brain region implicated in a range of social-cognitive processes, notably

including perspective-taking, theory of mind, and self-other distinction—functions that are foundational for effective

persuasive communication. Research across neuroimaging, lesion, and hyperscanning studies consistently demonstrates

that the TPJ, particularly in the right hemisphere, is activated when individuals engage in tasks requiring them to adopt

another's viewpoint or infer others' mental states, both of which are essential for understanding and influencing others

during persuasive exchanges (Schurz et al., 2015; Quesque & Brass, 2019; Healey & Grossman, 2018; Gvirts & Perlmutter,

2019; Bukowski, 2018; Igelström & Graziano, 2017; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024). The TPJ's involvement extends to the

detection of mental conflict, monitoring alignment between self and other perspectives, and facilitating neural synchrony

between communicators, all of which underpin mutual understanding and successful persuasion (Kelsen et al., 2020;

Deschrijver & Palmer, 2020; Healey & Grossman, 2018; Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019). Moreover, the TPJ operates within a

broader network that includes the prefrontal cortex and precuneus, supporting both cognitive and affective dimensions

of perspective-taking (Healey & Grossman, 2018; Bukowski, 2018; Igelström & Graziano, 2017). Despite robust evidence

for the TPJ's centrality, ongoing debates concern the specificity of its functions, its interaction with other brain regions,

and the causal mechanisms underlying its role in persuasive communication (Quesque & Brass, 2019; Donaldson et al.,

2015; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024). This review synthesizes the current literature to clarify the TPJ's contributions to

perspective-taking in persuasive contexts and highlights key methodological and theoretical advances.

2. Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, encompassing

databases such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy included targeted queries on the TPJ's role in

perspective-taking, social cognition, and persuasive communication, as well as comparative and methodological studies.

In total, 947 papers were identified, 644 were screened, 162 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers

were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. TPJ as a Hub for Perspective-Taking and Social Cognition

Multiple studies confirm that the TPJ is consistently activated during tasks requiring perspective-taking, theory of mind,

and self-other distinction, supporting its role as a domain-general mechanism for distinguishing between self and other

representations (Schurz et al., 2015; Quesque & Brass, 2019; Healey & Grossman, 2018; Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019;

Bukowski, 2018; Igelström & Graziano, 2017; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024). This activation is observed across both cognitive

(beliefs, thoughts) and affective (emotions, feelings) dimensions of perspective-taking (Healey & Grossman, 2018).

3.2. TPJ in Persuasive Communication and Neural Alignment

Hyperscanning and neuroimaging studies reveal that successful persuasive communication is associated with interbrain

synchrony, particularly in the TPJ and prefrontal cortex, suggesting that neural alignment in these regions facilitates

mutual understanding and effective persuasion (Kelsen et al., 2020; Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019). The TPJ's involvement is

linked to the ability to monitor and adapt to the mental states of others, a process essential for tailoring persuasive

messages (Deschrijver & Palmer, 2020; Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019).

3.3. Functional Specificity and Network Interactions

The TPJ does not operate in isolation; it interacts with the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and limbic regions, with evidence

for both shared and dissociable substrates for cognitive and affective perspective-taking (Healey & Grossman, 2018;

Bukowski, 2018; Igelström & Graziano, 2017). Comparative studies highlight the TPJ's unique contribution to detecting

mental conflict and redirecting attention to salient social cues, distinguishing its function from other network nodes

(Deschrijver & Palmer, 2020; Corbetta & Shulman, 2002; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024).

3.4. Methodological Advances and Limitations

Recent work using noninvasive brain stimulation and hyperscanning has advanced understanding of the TPJ's causal role,
but challenges remain in disentangling overlapping functions and ensuring precise experimental control (Kelsen et al.,

2020; Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019; Donaldson et al., 2015; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024). Methodological critiques emphasize the

need for improved task design and neuroimaging techniques to clarify the TPJ's specific contributions to persuasive
communication (Donaldson et al., 2015; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024).

4. Discussion

The evidence robustly supports the TPJ as a central hub for perspective-taking, self-other distinction, and theory of mind,

all of which are foundational for persuasive communication (Schurz et al., 2015; Quesque & Brass, 2019; Healey &
Grossman, 2018; Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019; Bukowski, 2018; Igelström & Graziano, 2017; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024). The
TPJ's role extends beyond simple mental state attribution to include monitoring mental conflict and facilitating neural

synchrony between communicators, which are critical for mutual understanding and effective persuasion (Kelsen et al.,
2020; Deschrijver & Palmer, 2020; Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019). However, the TPJ's functions are not entirely domain-
specific; it operates within a distributed network, with its contributions modulated by interactions with the prefrontal
cortex, precuneus, and limbic regions (Healey & Grossman, 2018; Bukowski, 2018; Igelström & Graziano, 2017).

Methodological advances, such as hyperscanning and noninvasive stimulation, have clarified some causal mechanisms
but also highlight the complexity and variability of TPJ functions across individuals and contexts (Kelsen et al., 2020;
Gvirts & Perlmutter, 2019; Donaldson et al., 2015; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024). Limitations include challenges in experimental

design, anatomical variability, and the need for more ecologically valid paradigms to capture real-world persuasive
communication (Donaldson et al., 2015; Ptak & Bourgeois, 2024).

5. Conclusion

The TPJ is a central neural hub for perspective-taking and self-other distinction, underpinning effective persuasive
communication through its role in mentalizing, monitoring mental conflict, and facilitating neural synchrony. While its

involvement is robustly supported, ongoing research is needed to clarify its specific functions, network interactions, and
causal mechanisms in real-world persuasive contexts.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite significant advances, gaps remain in understanding the TPJ's precise causal role, its functional subdivisions, and
its interaction with other brain regions during naturalistic persuasive communication. There is also a need for more

ecologically valid paradigms and longitudinal studies.
