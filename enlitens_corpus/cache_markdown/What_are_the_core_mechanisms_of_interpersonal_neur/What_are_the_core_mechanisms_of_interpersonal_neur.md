Core Mechanisms of Interpersonal Neurobiology in a Clinical Setting

1. Introduction

Interpersonal neurobiology (IPNB) is an integrative framework that explores how relationships and the brain

interact to shape mental health, development, and therapeutic change. In clinical settings, IPNB emphasizes the

dynamic, reciprocal, and embodied nature of human connection, focusing on mechanisms such as

intersubjectivity, neural synchrony, right-brain-to-right-brain communication, affect regulation, and

integration. These mechanisms underpin the therapeutic alliance, facilitate emotional healing, and promote well-

being by leveraging the brain’s inherent social and plastic capacities (Schore, 2021; Ellingsen et al., 2020; Schore,

2014; Siegel & Drulis, 2023; Lotter et al., 2022; Dumas, 2022; Schore, 2022; Siegel, 2019; Siegel, 2006; Sened et al.,

Schore, 2014; Bolis et al., 2022; Müller et al., 2021; Reindl et al., 2018).

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy included 20 targeted queries across 8 thematic groups, focusing on

foundational theory, mechanistic breakdown, clinical application, and adjacent fields. In total, 1,029 papers were

identified, 714 were screened, 511 were deemed eligible, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this
review.

3. Results

3.1. Intersubjectivity and Right-Brain-to-Right-Brain Communication

IPNB highlights the primacy of nonverbal, implicit, right-brain-mediated communication in therapeutic

relationships. Intersubjectivity—mutual, moment-to-moment sharing and regulation of emotional states—occurs

through rapid, reciprocal, nonverbal exchanges (facial expression, tone, gesture) that synchronize the emotional

and physiological states of therapist and client (Schore, 2021; Schore, 2014; Schore, 2022; Schore & Schore, 2014;

Bolis et al., 2022). This process is foundational for building trust, safety, and therapeutic alliance.

3.2. Neural and Physiological Synchrony

Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) and physiological synchrony (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) are core

mechanisms by which brains and bodies align during social interaction. Hyperscanning and neuroimaging studies

show that synchrony in regions such as the right temporoparietal junction and prefrontal cortex is associated with

empathy, rapport, and effective therapy (Ellingsen et al., 2020; Lotter et al., 2022; Dumas, 2022; Sened et al., 2025;

Sened et al., 2022; Konrad et al., 2024; Palumbo et al., 2017; Bolis et al., 2022; Müller et al., 2021; Reindl et al.,

2018). Synchrony is dynamic, context-dependent, and linked to positive clinical outcomes.

3.3. Affect Regulation and Attachment

The interactive regulation of affect—the ability to co-regulate emotional states within the therapeutic dyad—is
central to IPNB. This process draws on attachment theory, emphasizing the role of early relational experiences in
shaping the brain’s capacity for self- and co-regulation. In therapy, the clinician’s attuned presence helps clients

develop new patterns of affect regulation and secure attachment (Schore, 2014; Schore, 2022; Schore, 2012;

Siegel, 2017; Feldman, 2017; Montgomery, 2020; Schore & Schore, 2014; Reindl et al., 2018).

3.4. Integration and Neural Plasticity

IPNB posits that integration—the linkage of differentiated neural and psychological processes—is the basis of
mental health. Therapeutic interventions that foster integration (e.g., mindfulness, attunement, compassion)

promote neural plasticity, flexibility, and resilience (Siegel & Drulis, 2023; Siegel, 2019; Siegel, 2006; Badenoch &

Cox, 2010; Siegel, 2017; Feldman, 2017; Bolis et al., 2022). The mind is seen as both embodied and relational, with
integration emerging from both intra- and interpersonal experiences.

4. Discussion

The literature converges on several core mechanisms of interpersonal neurobiology in clinical settings:

•

•

•

•

Intersubjectivity and right-brain-to-right-brain communication are foundational for building therapeutic
alliance and facilitating emotional healing (Schore, 2021; Schore, 2014; Schore, 2022; Schore & Schore, 2014).

Neural and physiological synchrony between therapist and client is a measurable and dynamic process that

supports empathy, rapport, and positive outcomes (Ellingsen et al., 2020; Lotter et al., 2022; Dumas, 2022;

Sened et al., 2025; Sened et al., 2022; Konrad et al., 2024; Palumbo et al., 2017; Bolis et al., 2022; Müller et al.,

2021; Reindl et al., 2018).

Affect regulation and attachment processes are central, with therapy providing a corrective relational
experience that fosters new patterns of regulation and secure attachment (Schore, 2014; Schore, 2022; Schore,

2012; Siegel, 2017; Feldman, 2017; Montgomery, 2020; Schore & Schore, 2014; Reindl et al., 2018).

Integration and neural plasticity are the ultimate goals, with therapy promoting the linkage of differentiated

neural and psychological processes, leading to resilience and well-being (Siegel & Drulis, 2023; Siegel, 2019;

Siegel, 2006; Badenoch & Cox, 2010; Siegel, 2017; Feldman, 2017; Bolis et al., 2022).

These mechanisms are supported by advances in hyperscanning, neuroimaging, and psychophysiological
measurement, which allow for real-time assessment of synchrony and attunement in clinical interactions (Ellingsen

et al., 2020; Lotter et al., 2022; Dumas, 2022; Sened et al., 2025; Sened et al., 2022; Konrad et al., 2024; Palumbo

et al., 2017; Bolis et al., 2022; Müller et al., 2021; Reindl et al., 2018). However, challenges remain in translating these

findings into standardized interventions and in understanding individual and contextual moderators.

5. Conclusion

Interpersonal neurobiology in clinical settings is grounded in mechanisms of intersubjectivity, neural and

physiological synchrony, affect regulation, and integration. These processes are central to therapeutic change,

alliance, and well-being, and are increasingly supported by empirical research. Ongoing work is needed to refine
interventions and understand individual and contextual moderators.
