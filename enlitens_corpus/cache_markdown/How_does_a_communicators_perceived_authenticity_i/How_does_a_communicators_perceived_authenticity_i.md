Yes, a communicator’s perceived authenticity significantly increases the
persuasiveness of their message by enhancing trust, credibility, and audience
engagement.

1. Introduction

Perceived authenticity—how genuine, sincere, and true-to-self a communicator appears—has emerged as a

critical driver of persuasive effectiveness across domains such as marketing, health communication, politics, and

social media. Research consistently shows that when audiences perceive a communicator as authentic, they are

more likely to trust the message, feel connected to the source, and be influenced in their attitudes and behaviors

(Markowitz et al., 2022; Zniva et al., 2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Pérez, 2019; Buvár et al., 2023; Saffran et al., 2020;

Schneller, 2021; Shoenberger et al., 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Liu & Zheng, 2024; Chen et al., 2022; Lee & Eastin,

2020; Kapoor et al., 2022; Park et al., 2021). Authenticity enhances message and source credibility, reduces

skepticism, and fosters emotional engagement, which together increase the likelihood of persuasion (Pérez, 2019;

Buvár et al., 2023; Markowitz et al., 2022; Pérez et al., 2020; Zniva et al., 2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Shoenberger et

al., 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Liu & Zheng, 2024; Chen et al., 2022). However, the impact of authenticity can be

context-dependent, with factors such as audience characteristics, message content, and the communicator’s

consistency or uniqueness moderating its effects (McGinnies & Ward, 1980; Vargiu, 2022; Becker et al., 2018; Lee

et al., 2020; Kumar & Kaushik, 2022; Balaban & Szambolics, 2022; Park et al., 2021). While authenticity is generally

beneficial, excessive or inauthentic displays can sometimes backfire, especially if perceived as manipulative or
incongruent with the communicator’s identity (Becker et al., 2018; Audrezet et al., 2020; Montgomery, 2017).

Overall, the literature strongly supports the persuasive power of perceived authenticity.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The search targeted studies on communicator authenticity, message
persuasiveness, source credibility, and related constructs across multiple disciplines. In total, 1,036 papers were

identified, 731 were screened, 581 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this

review.

3.1 Authenticity as a Driver of Persuasion

Perceived authenticity consistently predicts greater message persuasiveness across contexts. Authentic
communicators are seen as more trustworthy, credible, and relatable, which increases audience receptivity and

attitude change (Markowitz et al., 2022; Zniva et al., 2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Pérez, 2019; Buvár et al., 2023;

Saffran et al., 2020; Schneller, 2021; Shoenberger et al., 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Liu & Zheng, 2024; Chen et al.,
2022; Lee & Eastin, 2020; Kapoor et al., 2022; Park et al., 2021). In influencer marketing, authenticity is a key

determinant of purchase intention and brand engagement (Zniva et al., 2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Audrezet et al.,

2020; Kapoor et al., 2022; Park et al., 2021; Liu & Zheng, 2024). In political and health communication, authentic
messages foster trust and reduce resistance (Petraglia, 2009; Saffran et al., 2020; Schneller, 2021; Enli, 2024;

Shoenberger et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Montgomery, 2017).

3.2 Mechanisms: Trust, Credibility, and Emotional Engagement

Authenticity enhances persuasion by increasing source and message credibility, reducing skepticism, and fostering

emotional connection (Pérez, 2019; Buvár et al., 2023; Markowitz et al., 2022; Pérez et al., 2020; Zniva et al., 2023;
Lee & Eastin, 2021; Shoenberger et al., 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Liu & Zheng, 2024; Chen et al., 2022). Sincerity,

consistency, and alignment with personal values are core components of perceived authenticity (Zniva et al., 2023;

Lee & Eastin, 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Balaban & Szambolics, 2022; Park et al., 2021; Liu & Zheng, 2024).

Audiences are more likely to scrutinize and accept messages from communicators they perceive as honest and
authentic (Priester & Petty, 1995; McGinnies & Ward, 1980; Buvár et al., 2023; Saffran et al., 2020; Schneller, 2021;

Zniva et al., 2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Shoenberger et al., 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Liu & Zheng, 2024; Chen et

al., 2022).

3.3 Moderators and Contextual Factors

The persuasive impact of authenticity is moderated by factors such as audience involvement, message content,

and communicator-audience similarity (McGinnies & Ward, 1980; Vargiu, 2022; Becker et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020;
Kumar & Kaushik, 2022; Balaban & Szambolics, 2022; Park et al., 2021). For example, authenticity is especially

influential for low-involvement audiences or when the communicator is seen as unique and consistent (Zniva et al.,

2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Kumar & Kaushik, 2022; Balaban & Szambolics, 2022; Park et al.,
2021). However, excessive or performative authenticity can sometimes reduce persuasiveness if perceived as

inauthentic or manipulative (Becker et al., 2018; Audrezet et al., 2020; Montgomery, 2017).

3.4 Risks and Limitations

While authenticity generally enhances persuasion, it can backfire if audiences perceive it as insincere or

inconsistent with the communicator’s identity (Becker et al., 2018; Audrezet et al., 2020; Montgomery, 2017). The

effectiveness of authenticity also varies by context, product type, and audience characteristics (McGinnies & Ward,
1980; Vargiu, 2022; Becker et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; Kumar & Kaushik, 2022; Balaban & Szambolics, 2022; Park

et al., 2021).

4. Discussion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that perceived authenticity is a powerful driver of message

persuasiveness. Authenticity enhances trust, credibility, and emotional engagement, which are central to effective

persuasion (Markowitz et al., 2022; Zniva et al., 2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Pérez, 2019; Buvár et al., 2023; Saffran et

al., 2020; Schneller, 2021; Shoenberger et al., 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Liu & Zheng, 2024; Chen et al., 2022; Lee

& Eastin, 2020; Kapoor et al., 2022; Park et al., 2021). This effect is robust across domains, including marketing,

health, politics, and social media. The mechanisms underlying this effect include increased trust, reduced
skepticism, and greater identification with the communicator (Pérez, 2019; Buvár et al., 2023; Markowitz et al.,

2022; Pérez et al., 2020; Zniva et al., 2023; Lee & Eastin, 2021; Shoenberger et al., 2021; Audrezet et al., 2020; Liu &

Zheng, 2024; Chen et al., 2022).

However, authenticity is not a panacea. Its persuasive power is moderated by context, audience, and message

characteristics. Excessive or performative authenticity can backfire, and the impact of authenticity may be weaker

for highly involved or skeptical audiences (Becker et al., 2018; Audrezet et al., 2020; Montgomery, 2017). Future

research should further explore these boundary conditions and the potential for authenticity to be strategically

manipulated.

5. Conclusion

Perceived authenticity is a robust and multifaceted driver of message persuasiveness, operating through enhanced

trust, credibility, and emotional engagement. Its effects are context-dependent and can be moderated by audience

and message characteristics, but the overall evidence strongly supports its persuasive power.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence, gaps remain in understanding the long-term effects of authenticity, its strategic use, and

its impact across diverse audiences and contexts. More research is needed on the potential for authenticity to be

manipulated and on its effects in high-stakes or controversial domains.
