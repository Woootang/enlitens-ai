DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This research paper by Becker, Yu, and Cabeza investigates the link between the subjective 
"AHA!" experience of insight, the brain's internal reward system, and subsequent behavior. The 
findings are highly relevant to Enlitens as they provide neurobiological validation for an insight-
based, non-linear cognitive style often reported by neurodivergent individuals, demonstrating 
that the "AHA!" moment is a real, rewarding, and motivating event. Furthermore, the study's 
methodology, which relies on quantifying subjective self-reports, strongly supports the validity of
clinical interviews as a tool for capturing the essential, individualized cognitive processes that 
standardized tests completely ignore.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"During insightful problem solving, the solution appears unexpectedly and is accompanied by 
the feeling of an AHA!."

"The positive affect of the AHA! experience has been linked to internal reward."

"But when they do, the idea or solution finding feels internally rewarding including a feeling of 
suddenness and certainty."

"The affective component of the AHA! experience is functionally important because it motivates 
future behaviour related and unrelated to the content of the insight."

"Note, previous work has suggested that the AHA! experience is also related to a reward 
prediction error as it reflects the subjective response to a better than expected outcome, i.e. the 
sudden solution is unexpected followed by positive arousal and internal reward."

"However, recent studies have shown that the AHA! experience is a continuous phenomenon 
consisting of multiple components, in particular (1) positive emotional response upon solution 
finding, (2) perceived suddenness of the solution and (3) certainty about the correctness of 
solution."

"In sum, across both studies, we found preliminary behavioural and neural evidence supporting 
insight as an internal reward signal in the NAcc that can promote risk-seeking behaviour 
possibly via dopaminergic signal transmission."

"People feel more motivated after finding a solution accompanied by insight and the presence of
insight can impact subsequent decision making."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

Study 1: Behavioral Evidence

● Hypothesis: Participants will favor a higher monetary reward with uncertainty over a 

lower fixed reward after solving a problem with a high "AHA!" experience.

● Finding: Insight significantly predicted the subsequent bonus choice.
● Statistic: Chi²(1) = 9.41, p < 0.005, with an odds ratio for high-insight trials of 

1.18 (95% CI [1.06, 1.32]).

● Interpretation: "Participants were more likely to choose the risk payout (over the fixed 

payout) when they correctly solved a Mooney image with HI-I (38%) compared to solving
with LO-I (33%)".

● Dimensional Finding: The effect was also significant when using the continuous 1-7 

AHA! rating scale (Chi²(1) = 13.20, p < 0.0002). "Therefore, the more strongly 
participants rated to have had an AHA! experience the more likely they were to choose 
the risk payout".

Study 2: fMRI Evidence

● Hypothesis: Insightful problem solving is associated with heightened activity in the 
Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), a proxy for reward-related dopaminergic activity.

● Finding: A binary measure of the AHA! experience (High vs. Low Insight) significantly 

predicted BOLD activity in the NAcc.

● Statistic: Chi²(1) = 16.78, p < 0.0001, with a beta estimate for high-insight of 

0.37 (95% CI [0.24, 0.59]).

● Interpretation: "HI-I trials (beta=0.083, 95% [0.03,0.13]) are associated with more 

BOLD activity in NAcc than LO-I trials (beta 0.037, 95% [-0.09, -0.02])".

● Link to Positive Emotion: "When testing the relationship between individual 

components of the AHA! and NAcc activity, positive emotion alone was a significant 
predictor for NAcc activity during insight (Chi²(1) = 6.22, p < 0.013, β = 0.05, 
95% CI [0.01, 0.08]) over and beyond suddenness and certainty."

● Interaction Effect: An interaction between positive emotion and certainty provided the 
best model fit, "suggesting that NAcc activity is highest, when participants rate their 
solution to be accompanied by a combination of high emotion and high certainty that it is
correct".

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

Assessing Insight (Quantifying Subjective Experience)

This study demonstrates how to rigorously measure a subjective, internal cognitive event, 
providing a powerful methodological precedent for Enlitens' clinical interview approach.

● Rejection of Binary Measurement: The study notes that insight was previously 

quantified in a binary way (present/absent) but that recent studies show the "AHA! 
experience is a continuous phenomenon consisting of multiple components".

● Key Components of "AHA!": The components identified are:
○ Positive emotional response upon solution finding
○ Perceived suddenness of the solution
○ Certainty about the correctness of the solution

● Study 1 Methodology (Combined Scale):

○ Participants were given a description of the AHA! experience that included all 

three components: "Insight describes the sudden and certain understanding of a 
problem that often involves an AHA!-experience. The AHA!-experience is the 
feeling of pleasure when the solution comes to you in a sudden manner."

○ They then provided a "combined rating" on a continuous scale from 1 to 7.
○ This was done "because too many individual ratings may diminish the potential 

transient effect of insight upon risk decision".

● Study 2 Methodology (Separate Scales):

○ In the fMRI study, insight was assessed via three consecutive ratings on a 1-4 

scale, one for each component.

■ Suddenness: "On a scale from 1 to 4: Did the solution come to you in a 

sudden or more gradual manner?"

■ Emotion: "On a scale from 1 to 4: How strong was your positive emotional

response upon solution?"

■ Certainty: "On a scale from 1 to 4: How certain are you that the solution is

correct?"

○ For comparability, the three scales were summed into one continuous compound

insight measure (ranging from 3 to 12).

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Insight as an Internal Reward Signal

The paper frames the "AHA!" experience as a tangible internal reward signal with clear 
neurobiological correlates and behavioral consequences.

● Connection to Reward Prediction Error: The AHA! experience is conceptualized as a 
form of reward prediction error. It "reflects the subjective response to a better than 
expected outcome, i.e. the sudden solution is unexpected followed by positive arousal 
and internal reward". This links the subjective feeling of insight directly to foundational 
learning and motivation mechanisms in the brain.

● Role of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc): The study hypothesizes that the NAcc, a key
brain region in the mesolimbic reward system, is central to this process. The NAcc is 
consistently linked to motivation and reward processing, and the study uses BOLD 
activity in this region as a proxy for reward-related dopaminergic signaling.

● Motivational Function: The core function of this internal reward is motivational. "The 

affective component of the AHA! experience is functionally important because it 
motivates future behaviour related and unrelated to the content of the insight". This 
suggests that the pleasure of insight is not merely an epiphenomenon but a key driver 
that encourages further problem-solving and potentially other exploratory behaviors.
● Dopamine's Role in Risky Decision Making: The framework is built on extensive prior 
research showing that dopaminergic activity in the NAcc influences decision-making. 
Dopamine is thought to modulate the "perceived attractiveness of risky options" , and 
fMRI studies show NAcc activity precedes and predicts financial risk-seeking. By linking 
the "AHA!" moment to NAcc activity, the paper provides a mechanistic explanation for 
why insight might promote a preference for high-reward, high-uncertainty choices.
