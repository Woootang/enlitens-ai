The Role of Prediction Error in Learning and Adaptation: A Comprehensive
Review

1. Introduction

Prediction error—the difference between expected and actual outcomes—is a foundational concept in

neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning, underpinning how organisms and systems learn and adapt to

their environments. Across domains, prediction error acts as a teaching signal, driving the updating of beliefs,

memories, and behaviors when reality deviates from expectation. This mechanism is evident in reinforcement

learning, motor adaptation, language acquisition, memory updating, and even social learning. Neural correlates of

prediction error, particularly in dopaminergic and striatal circuits, have been robustly linked to both trial-level

behavioral adjustments and long-term learning efficiency (Diederen et al., 2016; Rouhani & Niv, 2021; Cavanagh et

al., 2010; Sinclair et al., 2020; Fitz & Chang, 2019; Coddington & Dudman, 2018; Pine et al., 2018; Diederen &

Fletcher, 2020; Nasser et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2021; Bein et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2023; Vandendriessche &

Palminteri, 2023; Morehead et al., 2017; Corlett et al., 2022; Holland & Schiffino, 2016; Ouden et al., 2008; Watabe-

Uchida et al., 2017; Joiner et al., 2017; Izawa & Shadmehr, 2011; Diederen et al., 2017; Diederen & Schultz, 2015;

Steinberg et al., 2013; Schultz & Dickinson, 2000; Krawczyk et al., 2017; Hyman et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2014;

Marko et al., 2012). The universality and flexibility of prediction error make it a keystone for understanding adaptive

behavior in both humans and animals.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search strategy included 20 targeted queries across 8 thematic groups,
focusing on prediction error in learning, adaptation, reinforcement learning, memory, language, and motor control.

In total, 1,040 papers were identified, 667 were screened, 457 were deemed eligible, and the 50 most relevant

papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Prediction Error as a Universal Learning Signal

Prediction error is central to both associative and reinforcement learning models, such as the Rescorla-Wagner and

Sutton-Barto frameworks, where it determines the rate and direction of learning (Nasser et al., 2017; Holland &

Schiffino, 2016; Ouden et al., 2008; Joiner et al., 2017; Schultz & Dickinson, 2000). Neural evidence shows that

midbrain dopamine neurons encode reward prediction errors, which drive learning about cues and outcomes

(Diederen et al., 2016; Coddington & Dudman, 2018; Diederen & Fletcher, 2020; Nasser et al., 2017; Watabe-Uchida

et al., 2017; Diederen et al., 2017; Steinberg et al., 2013; Schultz & Dickinson, 2000). This signal is not limited to

reward but extends to sensory, social, and cognitive domains (Fitz & Chang, 2019; Pine et al., 2018; Corlett et al.,

2022; Holland & Schiffino, 2016; Ouden et al., 2008; Joiner et al., 2017; Izawa & Shadmehr, 2011; Schultz &

Dickinson, 2000).

3.2. Neural and Computational Mechanisms

•

Dopaminergic and Striatal Circuits: Dopamine neurons in the midbrain and striatum encode both signed and

unsigned prediction errors, modulating learning rates and memory formation (Diederen et al., 2016; Rouhani &
Niv, 2021; Coddington & Dudman, 2018; Pine et al., 2018; Diederen & Fletcher, 2020; Nasser et al., 2017;

Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017; Diederen et al., 2017; Diederen & Schultz, 2015; Steinberg et al., 2013; Schultz &
Dickinson, 2000).

•

•

Cortical and Hippocampal Involvement: Prediction errors are also processed in cortical and hippocampal
regions, influencing episodic memory updating and reconsolidation (Sinclair et al., 2020; Bein et al., 2019;

Sinclair & Barense, 2018; Pupillo et al., 2023; Möhring & Gläscher, 2023; Krawczyk et al., 2017).

Adaptive Coding: The brain adapts the coding of prediction errors to the variability of the environment,
optimizing learning efficiency (Diederen et al., 2016; Diederen et al., 2017; Diederen & Schultz, 2015).

3.3. Domain-Specific Applications

•

•

•

Motor Learning: Both sensory and reward prediction errors drive motor adaptation, with distinct contributions

to implicit and explicit learning processes (Kunavar et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2021; Morehead et al., 2017; Popa et

al., 2015; Izawa & Shadmehr, 2011; Albert & Shadmehr, 2018; Taylor et al., 2014; Marko et al., 2012; Albert et al.,
2023; Leow et al., 2018).

Language and Declarative Memory: Prediction error facilitates language acquisition, syntactic adaptation, and

declarative memory encoding, with evidence from both behavioral and neuroimaging studies (Greve et al., 2017;
Fitz & Chang, 2019; Bovolenta & Marsden, 2021; Kray et al., 2024; Wills et al., 2007; Pupillo et al., 2023; Nixon,

2020; O’Reilly et al., 2020; Ergo et al., 2019).

Social and Value-Based Learning: Prediction error mechanisms extend to social learning, where they guide
belief updating about others, and to value-based decision-making (Pine et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2023;

Vandendriessche & Palminteri, 2023; Corlett et al., 2022; Joiner et al., 2017; Banerjee et al., 2020; Marvin &

Shohamy, 2016).

2 / 9

3.4. Modulators and Constraints

•

•

•

Attention and Associability: Prediction error not only drives learning but also modulates attention to cues,

influencing which associations are formed or updated (Nasser et al., 2017; Holland & Schiffino, 2016; Wills et al.,
2007).

Learning Rate and Variability: The scaling of prediction errors and learning rates to environmental variability is

crucial for efficient adaptation; excessive or insufficient scaling impairs performance (Diederen et al., 2016;
Diederen et al., 2017; Diederen & Schultz, 2015; Marko et al., 2012).

Neuromodulation: Systems such as the locus coeruleus broadcast prediction errors to facilitate plasticity

across the cortex (Jordan & Keller, 2023).

4. Discussion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports prediction error as a central driver of learning and adaptation across
cognitive, motor, and social domains. Dopaminergic and striatal circuits encode prediction errors that modulate

learning rates, memory updating, and behavioral flexibility (Diederen et al., 2016; Coddington & Dudman, 2018;

Pine et al., 2018; Diederen & Fletcher, 2020; Nasser et al., 2017; Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017; Diederen et al., 2017;

Diederen & Schultz, 2015; Steinberg et al., 2013; Schultz & Dickinson, 2000). Prediction error is not a monolithic

signal; it is adaptively scaled to environmental variability and is modulated by attention, context, and

neuromodulatory systems (Diederen et al., 2016; Holland & Schiffino, 2016; Jordan & Keller, 2023; Wills et al., 2007;

Diederen et al., 2017; Diederen & Schultz, 2015; Marko et al., 2012).

In motor learning, both sensory and reward prediction errors contribute to adaptation, with distinct neural and

behavioral signatures (Kunavar et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2021; Morehead et al., 2017; Popa et al., 2015; Izawa &

Shadmehr, 2011; Albert & Shadmehr, 2018; Taylor et al., 2014; Marko et al., 2012; Albert et al., 2023; Leow et al.,
2018). In language and memory, prediction error facilitates the encoding of new information and the updating of

existing representations (Greve et al., 2017; Fitz & Chang, 2019; Bein et al., 2019; Bovolenta & Marsden, 2021; Kray

et al., 2024; Sinclair & Barense, 2018; Wills et al., 2007; Pupillo et al., 2023; Nixon, 2020; Krawczyk et al., 2017;

O’Reilly et al., 2020; Ergo et al., 2019). Social and value-based learning also rely on prediction error signals to

update beliefs and guide adaptive behavior (Pine et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2023; Vandendriessche & Palminteri,

2023; Corlett et al., 2022; Joiner et al., 2017; Banerjee et al., 2020; Marvin & Shohamy, 2016).

However, the precise mechanisms by which prediction error is computed, broadcast, and integrated across brain

regions remain active areas of research. There is also ongoing debate about the relative contributions of explicit

and implicit processes, and about how prediction error interacts with other learning signals.
