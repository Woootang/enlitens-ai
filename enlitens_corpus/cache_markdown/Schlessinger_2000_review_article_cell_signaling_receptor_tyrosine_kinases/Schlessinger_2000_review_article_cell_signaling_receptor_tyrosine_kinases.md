A large group of genes in all eukaryotes encode for proteins that function as membrane 
spanning cell surface receptors. Membrane receptors can be classified into distinct 
families based upon the ligands they recognize, the biological responses they induce 
and, more recently, according to their primary structures. A great variety of ligands bind 
to and regulate the activity of cell surface receptors, including small organic molecules, 
lipids, carbohydrates, peptides, and proteins. One large family of cell surface receptors 
is endowed with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. These receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTKs) catalyze transfer of the y phosphate of ATP to hydroxyl groups of 
tyrosines on target proteins (Hunter, 1998).

RTKs play an important role in the control of most fundamental cellular 
processes including the cell cycle, cell migration, cell metabolism and 
survival, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation.

All receptor tyrosine kinases contain an extracellular ligand binding domain that is 
usually glycosylated. The ligand binding domain is connected to the cytoplasmic domain
by a single transmembrane helix. The cytoplasmic domain contains a conserved 
protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) core and additional regulatory sequences that are 
subjected to autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by heterologous protein kinases 
(Hunter, 1998; Hubbard et al., 1998). Lymphokines such as erythropoietin and 
interferon also mediate their responses by tyrosine phosphorylation. However, rather 
than containing an intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity, the relatively short 
cytoplasmic domains of these receptors interact through noncovalent interactions with 
members of the Jak family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (Darnell et al., 1994; Ihle, 
1995). Apart from the lack of covalent linkage to a kinase, the mechanism of activation 
of these binary receptors largely resembles that of receptor tyrosine kinases (Lemmon 
and Schlessinger, 1994; Heldin, 1995; Jiang and Hunter, 1999).

The purpose of this review is to describe general concepts underlying the 
mechanism of action of RTKs and the signaling pathways that they regulate,
while attempting to shed light on the question of how specificity is defined by
the action of RTKs, and how a specific biological response can be 
generated by the diverse array of signaling pathways activated by all RTKs.

Paradigms for Receptor Activation

With the exception of the insulin receptor (IR) family of RTKs, all known RTKs (e.g., 
EGF receptor, PDGF receptor) are monomers in the cell membrane. Ligand binding 
induces dimerization of these receptors resulting in autophosphorylation of their 
cytoplasmic domains (Schlessinger, 1988; Lemmon and Schlessinger, 1994; Jiang and 
Hunter, 1999). Members of the IR family are disulfide linked dimers of two polypeptide 
chains forming an α2β2 heterodimer (Van-Obberghen, 1994). Insulin binding to the 
extracellular domain of the IR induces a rearrangement in the quaternary 
heterotetrameric structure that leads to increased autophosphorylation of the 
cytoplasmic domain. As the active forms of insulin receptor and monomeric RTKs are 
both dimeric, the signaling mechanisms of the two types of receptor are likely to be very
similar (Hubbard et al., 1998).

Activation by Dimerization

Although all RTKs are activated by dimerization, different ligands employ different 
strategies for inducing the active dimeric state. Structural studies of growth hormone 
(GH) in complex with GH receptor (GHR) and erythropoietin (EPO) in complex with 
EPO receptor (EPOR) show that these cytokines are bivalent, and one ligand binds 
simultaneously to two receptor molecules to form a 1:2 (ligand:receptor) complex 
(Kossiakoff and De Vos, 1998; Jiang and Hunter, 1999). Receptor dimerization is further
stabilized by additional receptor:receptor interactions.

Several growth factors are homodimers (e.g., VEGF, PDGF) providing the simplest 
mechanism for ligand-induced receptor dimerization. The VEGF receptors (VEGFR) 
contain seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in their extracellular domain, of which 

only Ig-domains 2 and 3 are required for ligand binding. The crystal structure of VEGF 
in complex with Ig-like domain 2 of the flt-1 VEGFR provides a view of ligand-induced 
receptor dimerization (Wiesmann et al., 1997). The structure shows that one receptor 
molecule binds at each of the two junctions between VEGF protomers to yield a 
complex that is close to 2-fold symmetric, and contains two VEGF protomers plus the 
two Ig-like domains.

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family consists of at least 21 related growth factors
(Maski and Ornitz, 1998). FGFs are unable to activate FGF receptors (FGFR) without 
cooperation of the accessory molecule heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) (Yayon 
et al., 1991). The crystal structures of FGF in complex with the ligand binding domain of 
FGFR (consisting of Ig-like domains-2 [D2] and -3 [D3]) provide a molecular view of 
FGFR dimerization (Plotnikov et al., 1999; Schlessinger et al., 2000) and activation and 
illustrate the determinants that govern FGF:FGFR specificity (Plotnikov et al., 2000). 
Each structure shows a 2:2 FGF:FGFR complex, in which FGF interacts extensively 
with D2, D3, and with the linker that connects these two domains within one receptor 
(the primary binding site). The dimer is stabilized by a secondary binding site involving 
interactions between FGF and D2 of the second receptor in the complex, as well as by 
receptor:receptor interactions. In contrast to the disulfide linked VEGF homodimer, the 
two FGF molecules in the 2:2 FGF:FGFR complex do not make any contact. Indeed, 
interactions between FGF and FGFR alone are not sufficient for stabilizing FGFR 
dimers at the cell surface under normal physiological conditions. Heparin or heparan 
sulfate proteoglycans are essential for stable dimerization of FGF:FGFR complexes 
(Spivak-Kroizman et al., 1994). It has been shown that heparin binds to a positively 
charged canyon formed by a cluster of exposed Lys and Arg residues that extends 
across the D2 domains of the two receptors in the dimer and the adjoining bound FGF 
molecules (Schlessinger et al., 2000). The full-length FGFR contains an additional Ig-
like domain (D1) and a stretch of acidic residues or "acid box" in the linker between D1 
and D2. Neither D1 nor the acid box is required for FGF binding to the FGFR. In fact, 
deletion of D1 and the acid box enhances binding of the receptor to FGF and heparin 
(Wang et al., 1995). Recent studies we have carried out lead us to propose that D1 and 
the acid box in full-length FGFR have an autoinhibitory function (Plotnikov et al., 1999). 
It is thought that the acid box can bind intramolecularly to the heparin binding site in D2,
competing with heparin for binding to this site. Similarly, D1 may interact 
intramolecularly with the ligand binding domain in D2 and D3 and thus interfere with 
FGF binding to FGFR. This autoinhibition would prevent accidental FGF-independent 
activation of FGFR by HSPGs that are abundant in the extracellular matrix and on cell 
surfaces. According to this view, the extracellular domain of FGFR has an 
autoregulatory function in addition to its roles in ligand recognition and receptor 
dimerization. A similar mechanism of autoinhibition may apply for other RTKs that 
contain multiple Ig-like domains in their extracellular domains (e.g., PDGFR, VEGFR). 
As only 2 out of the 5 Ig-like domains of PDGFR, and just 2 of the 7 Ig-like domains of 
VEGFR are essential for ligand binding, it is possible that the extra Ig-like domains not 
involved in ligand binding could play an autoregulatory role in these receptors.

The control of FGFR stimulation by two ligands, FGF and heparin, may provide a 
mechanism for localized activation of FGFR and vectorial stimulation of cell proliferation

or differentiation. The biosynthesis of HSPGs in restricted areas of the extracellular 
matrix of different tissues may provide a scaffold to which cells expressing FGFR will 
migrate, and on which these cells will survive, proliferate, or undergo differentiation 
when supplied with a specific FGF molecule. Indeed, it was demonstrated that FGF8 
and FGFR1 are essential for cell migration and mesodermal patterning during 
gastrulation (Yamaguchi et al., 1994; Sun et al., 1999).

Recent biochemical and structural studies and earlier experiments using monoclonal 
anti-receptor antibodies have demonstrated that only certain forms of receptor dimers 
with unique configurations of the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of both RTKs 
and cytokine receptors lead to trans-autophosphorylation and PTK stimulation (Lemmon
and Schlessinger, 1994; Jiang and Hunter, 1999). It is thought that receptor monomers 
are in equilibrium with receptor dimers. A limited population of receptor dimers exist with
quaternary structures of their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains in configurations 
that are compatible with trans-autophosphorylation and stimulation of PTK activity 
(active dimer). Ligand binding to the extracellular domain stabilizes the formation of 
active dimers and consequently PTK stimulation. We propose that active dimers exist 
even in the absence of ligand binding since autophosphorylation of RTKs can be 
enhanced by inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatases or by receptor overexpression 
even in the absence of ligand binding.

The Role of Receptor Hetero-Oligomerization

The EGFR family consists of four RTKs, EGFR (ErbB1), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. 
While EGFR has numerous ligands (e.g., EGF, TGF, HB-EGF), a ligand for ErbB2 has 
not been identified. The ligands for ErbB3 and ErbB4, the two other members of this 
RTK family, are the various isoforms of the neuregulins (NRG). It was demonstrated 
over a decade ago that EGF-induced stimulation of EGFR leads to activation of ErbB2 
by transduction through hetero-oligomerization (King et al., 1988; Stern and Kamps, 
1988; Wada et al., 1990). Subsequently, numerous studies have demonstrated that 
stimulation with EGF or NRG induces a combinatorial hetero-oligomerization of different
pairs of members of the EGFR family (Carraway and Cantley, 1994; Lemmon and 
Schlessinger, 1994; Olayioye et al., 2000). In the absence of a specific ligand for 
ErbB2, it was proposed that this RTK may function as a heterodimeric partner of the 
other members of the family, and could provide an additional platform for recruitment of 
intracellular signaling pathways in response to EGF or NRG stimulation. Moreover, 
since the sequence of the ErbB3 catalytic domain suggests that this receptor does not 
have PTK activity, it is thought that ErbB3 may function as a platform to expand the 
repertoire of intracellular signaling proteins recruited following its trans-phosphorylation 
by other members of the EGFR family (Carraway and Cantley, 1994).

In the absence of structural information about EGFR, it is difficult to present a clear 
molecular picture concerning the mechanism of receptor dimerization and hetero-
oligomerization. Biophysical studies have suggested that EGF is bivalent toward EGFR 
and shown that EGF can drive dimerization of the EGFR extracellular domain ending 
with a stoichiometry of 2:2 EGF:EGFR (Lemmon et al., 1997; Ferguson et al., 2000). It 
has been proposed that the bivalency of EGF or NRG is the driving force for 

heterodimerization of ErbB2 with other members of the EGFR family (Tzahar et al., 
1997). However, presently there is no evidence for binding of EGF or NRG to the 
extracellular domain of ErbB2 (Feurguson et al., 2000). The exact mechanism of ligand-
dependent dimerization of members of the EGFR family must await the determination 
of the three-dimensional structures of these complexes. An alternative mechanism is 
that two receptor homodimers form a heterodimer. A potential mechanism for EGF-
induced heterotetramer formation between EGFR and ErbB2 is that EGF-induced 
homodimers form a tetrameric complex with unoccupied homodimers of ErbB2 by 
receptor:receptor interactions. The interactions between the two homodimers within the 
context of a heterotetramer could serve to stabilize the formation of one dimer indirectly 
by growth factor binding. For example, binding of two monomeric ErbB2 proteins to an 
EGF-induced homodimer of EGFR may cause homodimerization of the ErbB2 
molecules followed by their trans-autophosphorylation and consequent activation 
(Honegger et al., 1990; Qian et al., 1994; Gamett et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1998). The 
mechanism of heterotetramer formation between ErbB3 and ErbB4 may be different, 
since both receptors bind NRG and may undergo NRG-dependent homodimerization. In
this case, ErbB3 homodimers may interact with NRG-induced homodimers of ErbB4, 
which in turn will phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domains of ErbB3 proteins by trans-
phosphorylation. In other words, homodimers of ErbB3 may in fact be preferable 
substrates of ErbB4 within the context of a heterotetrameric complex.

Structural studies of the catalytic core of several RTKs, together with biochemical and 
kinetic studies of receptor phosphorylation and activation have provided insights into the
mechanism by which RTK dimerization activates enzymatic activity (Hubbard et al., 
1994; Mohammadi et al., 1996; Hubbard, 1997). The emerging picture is that receptor 
oligomerization increases the local concentration of the PTK, leading to more efficient 
transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the catalytic domain 
(Hubbard et al., 1998). Structural studies have shown that, upon tyrosine 
phosphorylation, the activation loop adopts an "open" configuration that permits access 
to ATP and substrates, and enables phosphotransfer from MgATP to tyrosines on the 
receptor itself and on cellular proteins involved in signal transmission.

Mechanism of Activation of Signaling Proteins

In addition to its central role in the control of protein tyrosine kinase activity, tyrosine 
autophosphorylation of RTKs is crucial for recruitment and activation of a variety of 
signaling proteins. Most tyrosine autophosphorylation sites are located in noncatalytic 
regions of the receptor molecule. These sites function as binding sites for SH2 (Src 
homology 2) or PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domains of a variety of signaling 
proteins. SH2 domain-mediated binding of signaling proteins to tyrosine 
autophosphorylation sites provides a mechanism for assembly and recruitment of 
signaling complexes by activated receptor tyrosine kinases.

According to this view, every RTK should be considered not only as a 
receptor with tyrosine kinase activity but also as a platform for the 
recognition and recruitment of a specific complement of signaling proteins 
(Pawson and Schlessinger, 1993).

Signaling proteins containing SH2 and PTB domains are modular in nature (Kuriyan 
and Cowburn, 1997; Pawson and Scott, 1997; Margolis, 1999). Many of these proteins 
contain intrinsic enzymatic activities and protein modules that bring about interactions 
with other proteins, with phospholipids, or with nucleic acids.

Modular Domains of Signaling Proteins

SH2 domains bind specifically to distinct amino acid sequences defined by 1 to 6 
residues C-terminal to the pTyr moiety (Songyang et al., 1993), while PTB domains bind
to pTyr within context of specific sequences 3 to 5 residues to its N terminus (Margolis, 
1999). Certain PTB domains bind to nonphosphorylated peptide sequences, while still 
others recognize both phosphotyrosine-containing and nonphosphorylated sequences 
equally well (Margolis, 1999). SH3 domains bind specifically to the proline-rich 
sequence motif PXXP, while WW domains bind preferentially to another proline-rich 
motif PXPX (Kuriyan and Cowburn, 1997). Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 
comprise a large family of more than a hundred domains. While certain PH domains 
bind specifically to Ptdins (4,5)P2, another subset of PH domains binds preferentially to 
the products of agonist-induced phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI-3 kinase) (Ferguson 
et al., 1995; Lemmon et al., 1995, 1996; Czech, 2000). As only a small subset of PH 
domains bind specifically to phosphoinositides or to their soluble head groups, the 
physiological ligands of the majority of PH domains remain to be identified. However, 
the weak and nonspecific binding of most PH domains to phosphoinositides may be 
compensated for by the oligomeric nature of certain PH domain-containing proteins 
leading to strong membrane association (Lemmon and Ferguson, 2000). Finally, FYVE 
domains comprise another family of small protein modules that specifically recognize 
PtdIns-3-P (Fruman et al., 1999), and PDZ domains belong to another large family of 
independent protein modules that bind specifically to hydrophobic residues at the C 
termini of their target proteins (Gomperts, 1996).

A large family of SH2 domain-containing proteins possess intrinsic enzymatic activities 
such as PTK activity (Src kinases), protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity 
(Shp2), phospholipase C activity (PLC), or Ras-GAP activity among other activities. 
Another family of proteins contains only SH2 or SH3 domains. These adaptor proteins 
(e.g., Grb2, Nck, Crk, Shc) utilize their SH2 and SH3 domains to mediate interactions 
that link different proteins involved in signal transduction. For example, the adaptor 
protein Grb2 links a variety of surface receptors to the Ras/MAP kinase signaling 
cascade. Grb2 interacts with activated RTKs via its SH2 domain and recruits the 
guanine nucleotide releasing factor Sos close to its target protein Ras at the cell 
membrane (Schlessinger, 1994; Pawson, 1995).

Docking Proteins

Agonist-induced membrane recruitment of signaling proteins stimulated by tyrosine 
phosphorylation is also mediated by a family of docking proteins. All docking 
proteins contain in their N termini a membrane targeting signal and in their C termini a 
large region that contains multiple binding sites for the SH2 domains of signaling 
proteins (Sun et al., 1993; Kouhara et al., 1997). Some docking proteins are 
associated with the cell membrane by a myristyl anchor (e.g., FRS2), while others have 

their own transmembrane domain (e.g., LAT) (Zhang et al., 1998a). However, most 
docking proteins contain a PH domain at their N terminus. Docking proteins such as 
Gab1 become associated with the cell membrane by binding of its PH domain to Ptdins 
(3,4,5)P3 in response to agonist-induced stimulation of PI-3 kinase (Rodrigues et al., 
2000). In addition to the membrane targeting signal, most docking proteins contain 
specific domains such as PTB domains that are responsible for complex formation with 
a particular set of cell surface receptors. The PTB domains of IRS1 and IRS2, for 
example, bind specifically to IR, IGF1-R or IL4-R. The PTB domains of FRS2α and 
FRS2β on the other hand, bind preferentially to FGFR or NGFR. It has been shown that
docking proteins function as platforms for the recruitment of signaling proteins in 
response to receptor stimulation. In fact, most of the signaling proteins that are 
activated in response to insulin or FGF stimulation are recruited via the IRS or FRS 
families of docking proteins and not by their direct binding to IR or FGFR. It appears 
that the total amount of signaling proteins that are recruited by a given activated RTK is 
the sum of the proteins recruited by the receptor directly, and those recruited by 
docking proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated by the same receptor. Although 
many proteins serve as substrates of, and are activated by, RTKs, there appear to be 
three different general mechanisms for how signaling proteins are activated in response
to RTK stimulation.

Paradigms for Activation of Effector Proteins

Activation by Membrane Translocation.

PDGF-induced activation of PI-3 kinase leads to generation of the second messengers 
Ptdins (3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The generation of these second messengers plays 
a crucial role in the activation of PDK1 and PKB (also known as AKT), two highly 
conserved protein kinases that play an important role in stimulation of cell survival, 
protein synthesis, and metabolic processes. PDK1 has a PH domain at the C terminus 
of the protein through which it binds to Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 leading to membrane 
translocation (Alessi et al., 1997; Anderson et al., 1998). PKB, which is also recruited to
the membrane via its N-terminal PH domain binding to PI-3 kinase products (Franke et 
al., 1995; Frech et al., 1997), is phosphorylated by PDK1 on Thr308 in its activation 
loop. It has been proposed that an as yet unidentified protein kinase (hypothetical 
PDK2) is responsible for PKB phosphorylation on Ser473 leading to complete 
stimulation of PKB activity. However, it was recently reported that phosphorylation of 
Ser473 is mediated by PKB trans-autophosphorylation (Toker and Newton, 2000a, 
2000b).

Activation by a Conformational Change.

There is good evidence that SH2 domain-mediated binding of certain signaling proteins 
to phosphotyrosines on activated receptors induces a conformational change that 
releases an autoinhibition resulting in stimulation of enzymatic activity. For example, the
protein tyrosine kinase activity of Src is activated when its SH2 domain binds to tyrosine
autophosphorylation sites on PDGFR (Thomas and Brugge, 1997; Xu et al., 1999). 
Similarly, binding of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, to phosphotyrosines in 
the PDGFR or IRS1 causes conformational changes in p85 that are transmitted to the 

catalytic subunit p110 leading to enhancement of PI-3 kinase activity. In addition, by 
binding to tyrosine phosphorylated PDGFR or IRS1, PI-3 kinase is translocated to the 
cell membrane where its substrate Ptdlns(4,5)P2 is found.

Activation by Tyrosine Phosphorylation.

It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of certain target proteins is required for 
ligand stimulation of their enzymatic activity. In response to EGF, PDGF, or FGF 
receptor activation, the SH2 domains of PLCγ bind to specific phosphotyrosines in the 
C-terminal tails of these receptors. Binding of PLCγ to the activated receptor facilitates 
its efficient tyrosine phosphorylation by the RTK. PDGF-induced activation of 
phospholipase C activity is abrogated in cells expressing PLCγ mutated in the tyrosine 
phosphorylation sites (Kim et al., 1991). Activation of PLCγ is also dependent upon 
agonist-induced generation of PI-3 kinase products. Both tyrosine phosphorylation and 
membrane translocation of PLCγ through binding of its PH domain to Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 
are essential for complete activation of phospholipase-C activity leading to the 
generation of the two second messengers diacylglycerol and Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Falasca et 
al., 1998).

As many of the targets of RTKs are membrane linked, membrane translocation of key 
signaling components is critical in the process of signal transduction. At least two 
molecular events must take place before agonist-induced activation of each of the 
effector proteins described can occur. PKB activation, for example, requires 
translocation to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation by PDK1 on a key Thr 
residue. Furthermore, it was proposed that translocation of PKB to the cell membrane is
accompanied by release of an autoinhibition suggesting that a conformational change in
PKB may also take place and be required for phosphorylation by PDK1 and for kinase 
activation. PDGF-induced activation of PI-3 kinase is mediated by a conformational 
change in PI-3 kinase induced by p85 binding to pTyr sites on activated PDGFRS. 
Stimulation of PLCγ, on the other hand, is dependent on both tyrosine phosphorylation 
and PI-3 kinase activation. Membrane translocation is essential for PI-3 kinase and 
PLCγ activation, as Ptdlns(4,5)P2, the substrate of these two enzymes is located in the 
cell membrane.

Intracellular Signaling Pathways

The rapid progress in understanding intracellular signaling pathways that took place 
during the 1990s was largely due to the convergence of information generated by 
multiple scientific disciplines. Similar proteins were repeatedly identified by applying 
totally different methodologies. Key components of signaling pathways have been 
discovered in biochemical studies in which cellular proteins were isolated, cloned, and 
analyzed. The invertebrate C. elegans and Drosophila homologs of the same proteins 
have been found in genetic screens. Moreover, in many cases the same proteins have 
been identified as products of genes that are mutated in different human diseases such 
as cancer, severe skeletal disorders, immunodeficiencies, and neurological diseases. A 
picture is starting to emerge with regard to the different components of several signal 
transduction pathways and signaling networks that are activated by cell surface 
receptors. General principles that govern the spatiotemporal information flow from the 

cell surface to the nucleus, and the modes of communication between the different 
signaling pathways are becoming unveiled.

The Ras/MAP Kinase Signaling Cascade

All RTKs and many other cell surface receptors stimulate the exchange of GTP for GDP
on the small G protein Ras. Both biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated 
that Ras is activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos. The adaptor 
protein Grb2 plays an important role in this process by forming a complex with Sos via 
its SH3 domains. The Grb2/Sos complex is recruited to an activated RTK through 
binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain to specific pTyr sites of the receptor, thus translocating
Sos to the plasma membrane where it is close to Ras and can stimulate exchange of 
GTP for GDP (Schlessinger, 1994; Pawson, 1995; Bar-Sagi and Hall, 2000). Membrane
recruitment of Sos can be also accomplished by binding of Grb2/Sos to Shc, another 
adaptor protein that forms a complex with many receptors through its PTB domain 
(Margolis, 1999). Alternatively, Grb2/Sos complexes can be recruited to the cell 
membrane by binding to membrane-linked docking proteins such as IRS1 or FRS2α 
which become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of certain RTKs (Sun 
et al., 1993; Kouhara et al., 1997). There is also evidence that the PH domain of Sos is 
essential for membrane translocation and for complete activation of Ras. Once in the 
active GTP-bound state, Ras interacts with several effector proteins such as Raf and 
PI-3 kinase to stimulate numerous intracellular processes. Activated Raf stimulates 
MAP-kinase-kinase (MAPKK, MEK) by phosphorylating a key Ser residue in the 
activation loop. MAPKK then phosphorylates MAPK (ERK) on Thr and Tyr residues at 
the activation-loop leading to its activation. Activated MAPK phosphorylates a variety of 
cytoplasmic and membrane linked substrates (e.g., EGFR, Sos). In addition, MAPK is 
rapidly translocated into the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates transcription 
factors (Karin and Hunter, 1995; Hunter, 2000). The signaling cassette composed of 
MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK is highly conserved in evolution and several MAPK 
cascades exist in yeast, in invertebrates and vertebrates (Waskiewicz and Cooper, 
1995; Madhani and Fink, 1998; Garrington and Johnson, 1999). These highly 
conserved signaling cascades play an important role in the control of metabolic 
processes, cell cycle, cell migration, and cell shape as well as in cell proliferation and 
differentiation (Davis, 2000).

Phosphoinositol Metabolism and Cell Signaling

Activation of RTKs leads to rapid stimulation of phosphoinositol metabolism and 
generation of multiple second messengers (Rameh and Cantley, 1999; Czech, 2000). 
PLCγ is rapidly recruited by an activated RTK through the binding of its SH2 domains to
pTyr sites in the receptor molecules. Upon activation PLCγ hydrolyzes its substrate 
Ptdlns(4,5)P2 to form two second messengers, diacylglycerol and Ins(1,4,5)P3. By 
binding to specific intracellular receptors, Ins(1,4,5)P3 stimulates the release of Ca2+ 
from intracellular stores. Ca2+ then binds to calmodulin, which in turn activates a family 
of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. In addition, both diacylglycerol and 
Ca2+ activate members of the PKC family of protein kinases. The second messengers 
generated by Ptdlns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis stimulate a variety of intracellular responses in 

addition to phosphorylation and activation of transcriptional factors (Karin and Hunter, 
1995; Hunter, 2000).

The phospholipid kinase PI-3 kinase is activated by virtually all RTKs. One group of PI-
3 kinases are heterodimers composed of a regulatory subunit p85, which contains two 
SH2 and one SH3 domain and a catalytic subunit designated p110. Like other SH2 
domain-containing proteins, PI-3 kinase forms a complex with pTyr sites on activated 
receptors or with tyrosine phosphorylated docking proteins such as IRS1 and Gab1. 
Activated PI-3 kinase phosphorylates PtdIns(4)P and Ptdlns(4,5)P2 to generate the 
second messengers Ptdlns(3,4)P2 and Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3. Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 mediates 
membrane translocation of a variety of signaling proteins, such as the non-receptor 
protein tyrosine kinases Btk and Itk, the Ser/Thr kinases PDK1 and PKB, the Arf 
exchange factor Grp1, the docking protein Gab1, and PLCγ1, among many others 
(Rameh and Cantley, 1999; Czech, 2000). Membrane translocation is mediated through
binding of their PH domains to agonist-induced PI-3 kinase products leading to their 
activation and subsequent stimulation of a variety of cellular responses. One important 
response is stimulation of cell survival. It has been shown that PI-3 kinase-dependent 
activation of PKB leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. Phosphorylation of 
BAD prevents apoptotic cell death by blocking its complex formation with the apoptotic 
protein Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl (Datta et al., 1999). Another mechanism for inhibition of 
apoptosis is via PKB-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor FKHR1 (Brunet
et al., 1999), which in turn suppresses proapoptotic gene expression. Insulin-induced 
activation of PDK1 leads to phosphorylation and activation of S-6 kinase. Furthermore, 
glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and phosphofruckokinase, two enzymes that 
are regulated in response to insulin stimulation, are phosphorylated by PKB. PDK1 and 
PKB may play a role in the control of protein synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis
in response to insulin stimulation (Toker and Newton, 2000a).

PI-3 kinase also plays an important role in growth factor-induced hydrogen peroxide 
generation. It has been recently shown that PDGF-induced H2O2 generation is 
dependent upon activation of PI-3 kinase and the small G protein Rac (Bae et al., 
2000). Earlier studies demonstrated that activation of NADPH synthase, the enzyme 
complex that catalyzes the production of hydrogen peroxide, is an effector of Rac. 
Interestingly, EGF-induced generation of H2O2 is essential for sustained tyrosine 
autophosphorylation and activation of EGFR (Bae et al., 1997). Hydrogen peroxide that 
is generated in response to EGF stimulation oxidizes and inactivates a protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTP) that dephosphorylates activated EGFR (Lee et al., 1998; Bae et 
al., 2000). Regulation of EGFR kinase activity is not the only role of hydrogen peroxide 
in response to growth factor stimulation. There is good evidence that H2O2 plays an 
active role in the control of multiple cellular processes.

The activity of effector proteins that are dependent on PI-3 kinase activation can be 
negatively regulated by PTEN and SHIP, two phosphoinositide-specific phosphatases 
that dephosphorylate the 3' and 5' positions of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, 
respectively (Bolland et al., 1998; Maehama and Dixon, 1998). PTEN is a tumor 
suppressor protein that is mutated in a variety of human cancers leading to aberrant 
stimulation of cell survival pathway (Maehama and Dixon, 1998).

Nuclear Translocation of STATS

All lymphokines induce gene transcription by activating the JAK/STAT signaling 
pathway (Darnell et al., 1994; Ihle, 1995). The binding of lymphokines to their binary 
receptor complexes leads to the activation of JAK and subsequent tyrosine 
phosphorylation of STATs. This is followed by binding of the SH2 domain of STAT to 
pTyr sites on homotypic or heterotypic STATs enabling formation of STAT homodimers 
or heterodimers. The dimeric STATs migrate to the nucleus to activate transcription in a
target DNA sequence designated the GAS element. In addition to their central role in 
signaling via lymphokine receptors, there is good evidence that STATs play a role in 
signaling via RTKs. PDGF, EGF, or FGF stimulation leads to rapid tyrosine 
phosphorylation and migration of STATs to the nucleus and transcription of target DNA 
genes. The transcriptional program initiated by STATs is an integral component of the 
genetic program induced by growth factor stimulation. Moreover, there is good evidence
that STAT3 plays a role in PTK-induced oncogenic transformation, as constitutively 
dimeric forms of STAT3 promote tumor formation.

Mechanism of Signal Attenuation and Termination

The activity of RTKs must be tightly regulated and properly balanced in order to 
mediate their normal cellular tasks and their many physiological responses. Indeed, 
aberrant expression or dysfunction of RTKs is responsible for several diseases and 
developmental disorders. It is to be expected, therefore, that several mechanisms exist 
for the attenuation and termination of RTK activity induced by stimulatory ligands.

Antagonistic Ligands

In Drosophila, activation of the EGFR homolog by an EGF-like factor (e.g., Spitz) leads 
to the expression of a secreted EGF-like protein designated Argos. Genetic and 
biochemical experiments suggest that Argos binds to EGFR, competes with Spitz for 
receptor binding, and inhibits EGFR activity. It has been proposed that the regulated 
expression of an EGFR agonist (Spitz), and EGFR antagonist (Argos) is essential for 
the control of various regulatory networks in which EGFR plays an important role in 
Drosophila development (Casci and Freeman, 1999). No vertebrate homolog of Argos 
has been identified and the mechanism of its antagonistic activity is not yet understood 
(Jin et al., 2000).

Another example of an RTK antagonist comes from the family of angiopoietins. 
Angiopoietins belong to a family of multimeric proteins that regulate mammalian 
vascularization and angiogenesis. Angiopoietins bind specifically to and activate Tie2, 
an RTK expressed on the surface of endothelial cells that is implicated in the control of 
vascularization and angiogenesis. Interestingly, one group of angiopoietins inhibits the 
biological responses mediated by the Tie2 receptor (Maisonpierre et al., 1997). It is 
thought that the spatiotemporal expression of the stimulatory and inhibitory 
angiopoietins is critical for shaping and remodeling the vascular system during 
development. Moreover, the degree of receptor oligomerization induced by the inhibitory
or stimulatory angiopoietins may determine biological outcome.

Hetero-Oligomerization with Receptor Mutants

In addition to transcripts encoding for full-length RTKs, certain tissues express naturally 
occurring soluble or membrane-linked receptor variants that are deficient in RTK 
activity. Expression of an inactive deletion mutant in the same cell may result in 
dominant negative inhibition of full-length receptor through generation of inactive 
heterodimers or hetero-oligomers (Jaye et al., 1992). It is thought that one biological 
role of mutant receptor variants coexpressed in the same cell with full-length receptors 
is to provide a mechanism for attenuating of the signal generated by ligand stimulation 
of the full-length receptor.

Inhibition of RTK Activity

Activation of protein kinase-C (PKC) by G protein-coupled receptors or by PDGF or 
phorbol-esters (PMA) results in EGFR phosphorylation on multiple Ser and Thr 
residues, including Thr654 in the juxtamembrane domain of EGFR. PKC-induced 
phosphorylation of EGFR results in an inhibition of its PTK activity and in strong 
inhibition of EGF binding to the extracellular ligand binding domain (Cochet et al., 1984; 
Davis and Czech, 1985). PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane domain 
of EGFR thus appears to provide a negative feedback mechanism for control of 
receptor activity.

SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) belongs to a family of proteins that function
as negative regulators for feedback inhibition in response to cytokine stimulation (Hilton 
et al., 1998). It has been shown that SOCS proteins inhibit signaling in response to 
cytokine stimulation by direct binding to the PTK domain of JAK via their SH2 domains. 
There is now evidence that insulin stimulation induces the expression of SOCS-3 and 
that SOCS-3 binds directly to the IR suggesting that a similar negative feedback 
mechanism may take place in signaling via RTKs (Emmanuelli et al., 2000).

Inhibition by Tyrosine Phosphatases

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) play an important role in the control of RTK 
activity and the signaling pathways that they regulate. Virtually all RTKs can be 
activated, even in the absence of ligand binding, by treatment of cells with PTP 
inhibitors. This experiment demonstrates that the activity of RTKs is continuously being 
monitored and checked by inhibitory PTPs. The protein tyrosine kinase activity of most 
RTKs is positively regulated by one or several phosphotyrosine sites in the activation 
loop. Protein tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate these regulatory p-Tyr 
residues will inhibit RTK activity and the biological responses mediated by downstream 
effectors that depend on PTK activity. It was recently demonstrated that targeted gene 
disruption of PTP1B in mice leads to hyperphosphorylation of IR and IRS1 and 
sensitization of signaling via the IR in vitro and in the mutant mice. These data argue 
that PTP1B is an important negative regulator of IR (EIchebly et al., 1999).

Receptor Endocytosis and Degradation

Growth factor stimulation results in rapid endocytosis and degradation of both the 
receptor and the ligand. Ligand binding induces receptor clustering in coated pits on the

cell surface, followed by endocytosis, migration to multivesicular bodies and eventual 
degradation by lysosomal enzymes. It has been shown that degradation of EGFR is 
dependent on protein tyrosine kinase activity and that a kinase-negative receptor 
mutant recycles to the cell surface for reutilization (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990). The 
rapid endocytosis and degradation of activated EGFR and other RTKs attenuates the 
signal generated at the cell surface in response to growth factor stimulation. Recent 
studies suggest that the oncogenic protein Cbl plays a role in regulating EGFR and 
PDGFR degradation. Cbl contains several subdomains, including an SH2-like domain 
that is responsible for binding to activated RTKs, and a RING finger domain that 
functions as a ubiquitin ligase. Binding of EGFR or PDGFR to Cbl leads to 
ubiquitination of the receptor and subsequent degradation by the proteosome (Joazeiro 
et al., 1999). On the other hand, complex formation with activated receptors results in 
tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl followed by recruitment to it of signaling proteins such 
as PI-3 kinase, arguing that Cbl may also function as a docking protein for recruitment 
of effector proteins.

Coupling with Heterologous Signaling Pathways

In recent years it has become apparent that RTKs and the signaling pathways they 
activate are part of a large signaling network that can be regulated by multiple 
extracellular cues such as cell adhesion, agonists of G protein-coupled receptors, 
lymphokines or stress signals (Carpenter, 1999). It has also been shown that cell 
adhesion via integrin receptors leads to activation of several RTKs including the 
receptors for insulin, EGF, PDGF, and FGF resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of 
target proteins and activation of signaling pathways that are normally activated by these
receptors. It has been proposed that receptor activation induced by cell adhesion is 
mediated by coclustering of integrins with RTKs, although the precise mechanism of 
complex formation between integrins and RTKs is not understood.

RTKs have also been shown to be activated by membrane depolarization, by various 
stress responses including hyperosmotic conditions and ultraviolet radiation, as well as 
by G protein-coupled receptors (Carpenter, 1999). Agonists of several G protein-
coupled receptors (e.g., endothelin, lysophosphatidic acid, angiotensin, and thrombin) 
have been shown to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR or PDGFR. It has 
also been proposed that EGFR and PDGFR, as well as the nonreceptor PTKs, Src and 
PYK2, are crucial for coupling G protein-coupled receptors stimulation with the 
Ras/MAP kinase signaling cascade (Luttrell et al., 1999; Hackel et al., 1999). However,
it is not yet clear how Gi- and Gq-dependent pathways activate these protein tyrosine 
kinases. Moreover, MAP kinase stimulation induced by G protein-coupled receptors is 
normal in fibroblasts deficient in EGFR or in Src kinases.

There is also good evidence for coupling between EGFR signaling and the signaling 
pathway activated by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) receptors. The TGFβ 
family of cytokines mediate their biological responses by binding to and activating a 
hetero-tetrameric complex composed of receptors with Ser/Thr activity designated 
TGFβ receptor-I and -II (Massague et al., 2000). Stimulation of TGFβ receptors results 
in the phosphorylation of Smad proteins, followed by their translocation to the cell 

nucleus and consequent enhancement of transcriptional activity of target genes. EGF 
exerts an inhibitory response on TGFβ signaling, by inducing phosphorylation of Smad 
proteins at specific sites that prevent nuclear translocation and cause an inhibition of 
transcriptional activity (Kretzschmar et al., 1997; de Caestecker et al., 1998; Zhang et 
al., 1998b).

It is already apparent that signaling pathways do not function in isolation, 
and cannot be presented or considered in a simple linear fashion as would 
be proposed by genetic analyses. A more realistic picture is that signaling 
pathways are linked together in a large protein network that is subjected to 
multiple stimulatory and inhibitory inputs, as well as complex feedback 
mechanisms. Such complexity is essential for mediating the pleiotropic 
responses of growth factors in development and in the adult animal.

Factors that Determine the Specificity of Signaling Pathways

A major unanswered question in the field of signal transduction concerns the origin of 
signal specificity. How are the myriad of extracellular cues transmitted to induce specific
biological responses? It is not at all clear how activation of a given RTK at the cell 
membrane by a specific ligand could utilize the currently known repertoire of 
intracellular signaling pathways to transduce a unique biological response. Insulin and 
NGF, for instance, stimulate unique biological responses in their target tissues. Yet, the 
intracellular signaling pathways that are activated by insulin, NGF, or other growth 
factors are very similar indeed. In other instances, activation of the same signaling 
molecules in different cells leads to distinct responses. Why, for example, does 
stimulation of PI-3 kinase by insulin in muscle cells result in enhancement of metabolic 
processes, while stimulation of PI-3 kinase by NGF in neuronal cells leads to an 
antiapoptotic signal? Moreover, what are the factors that determine the biological 
outcome of a signal generated by a given receptor tyrosine kinase in different cellular 
context? Why does stimulation of an RTK (e.g., TrkA, FGFR, Ret) in fibroblasts result in
cell proliferation whereas stimulation of the same RTK in neuronal cells results in cell 
differentiation? Several mechanisms have been proposed for the control of specificity in 
cell signaling.

Combinatorial Control

Signal specificity may be defined in part by a combinatorial control. Every RTK recruits 
and activates a unique set of signaling proteins via its own tyrosine autophosphorylation
sites and by means of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites on closely associated docking
proteins (e.g., Gab1, FRS2). The combinatorial recruitment of a particular complement 
of signaling proteins from a common preexisting pool of signaling cassettes is one 
mechanism for control of signal specificity. This process is further regulated by 
differential recruitment of stimulatory and inhibitory proteins by the different receptors 
and downstream effector proteins leading to fine tuning of cellular responses.

The Role of Scaffold Proteins

It has been shown that scaffolding proteins that bind simultaneously to several 
proteins are able to insulate key components of signaling pathways from closely related 
signaling cascades (Whitmarsh and Davis, 1998). In yeast, the scaffolding protein Ste5 
has been shown to interact with a pheromone-activated G protein and with components 
of MAP kinase cascade. Ste5 forms a complex with Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3P leading to
insulation of pheromone-induced MAP kinase cascade from closely related signaling 
pathways. Another example is JIB, a protein that functions as a scaffolding protein in 
the JNK signaling cascade in mammalian cells (Davis, 2000). There is also evidence 
that particular members of the MAPK cascade form a complex with a specific upstream 
activating kinase and downstream effector-kinase to provide insulation from other MAP 
kinase cascades (Kallunki et al., 1994). It remains to be determined whether RTKs 
induce specific biological responses by utilizing specific scaffold proteins.

Cellular Compartmentalization

In recent years it has become apparent that the cellular localization of proteins involved 
in cell signaling has a profound impact on their biological activity. As many of the targets
of RTKs are located at the cell membrane, membrane translocation is required for 
activation of many cellular processes. Binding of SH2, PTB, or SH3 domains to 
activated receptors or to membrane-linked docking proteins leads to membrane 
translocation. In addition, membrane translocation is regulated in part by PH or FYVE 
domains, two protein modules that bind to different phosphoinositides. It has been 
shown that binding of proteins containing PDZ domains to their canonical target 
sequences at the C termini of signaling proteins will induce the assembly of specific sets
of signaling proteins in specific regions at the inner face of the cell membrane. Protein 
assembly at the cell membrane, mediated by multi-PDZ domain containing proteins, 
may facilitate the phosphorylation of specific substrates by a kinase that is part of the 
same complex or activation of a GTPase by an exchange factor that is located at the 
same assembly.

It has been proposed that a variety of proteins that are involved in cell signaling are 
concentrated in cholesterol-rich microdomains designated "membrane rafts" (Simons 
and Ikonen, 1997). It is thought that "membrane rafts" function as sites of assembly of 
proteins involved in cell signaling including cell surface receptors, GPI-liked proteins, 
Src kinases, and Ras proteins (Brown and London, 2000). However, it is not clear yet 
whether membrane rafts exist in the context of living cells (Edidin, 1997) or whether 
this phenomenon represents an artifact caused by detergent solubilization.

The translocation of STAT proteins from the cell membrane into the nucleus is another 
example for the role of protein localization in cell signaling (Darnell et al., 1994; Ihle, 
1995). Initially, STAT proteins are bound to the cytoplasmic domains of lymphokine 
receptors in proximity to protein tyrosine kinases of the JAK family. Stimulation of 
lymphokine receptor or RTKs leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT resulting in 
homotypic or heterotypic dimerization followed by nuclear translocation and regulation 
of transcription of target genes.

Signal Duration and Amplitude

Cellular signaling pathways could be considered as components of intracellular circuits 
that are generated by protein networks. According to this view, signal transmission and 
biological outcome should be affected by quantitative considerations such as signal 
duration and signal strength (Marshall, 1995). For instance, RTKs that induce transient 
stimulation of MAPK (e.g., EGFR, IR) stimulate PC12 cell proliferation while RTKs that 
stimulate a sustained and robust MAPK response (e.g., NGFR, FGFR) promote 
neuronal differentiation of the same cells. In fact, overexpression of IR or EGFR in 
PC12 cells leads to sustained MAPK response resulting in cell differentiation, although 
the same receptors give a proliferative response when expressed at lower levels.

These experiments shows that biological outcome (proliferation versus 
differentiation) is determined by quantitative modulation of signal threshold 
(Marshall, 1995).

Signal threshold can be determined by the specific activity of a given RTK, and by the 
balanced action of the various inhibitory or stimulatory signals that are activated by the 
RTK. For example, the signal generated by an RTK can be prolonged by generation of 
hydrogen peroxide that blocks inhibitory protein tyrosine phosphatases or by 
phosphorylation of docking proteins that promote signal amplification by recruiting of 
multiple signaling molecules. Signaling pathways are also subjected to multiple negative
feedback mechanisms at the level of the receptor itself by inhibitory protein tyrosine 
phosphatases and by receptor endocytosis and degradation. In addition, the specific 
activity of key effector proteins can be negatively regulated by inhibitory signals. For 
example, MAPK responses are inhibited by protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate 
and inactivate this enzyme. The two phosphoinositide phosphatases PTEN and SHIP 
dephosphorylate specifically the 3' or 5' phosphate of the Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 inositol ring, 
respectively, leading to inhibition of cellular responses mediated by PI-3 kinase 
products. The balance between the various stimulatory and inhibitory responses will 
ultimately determine the strength and duration of the signals that are transmitted 
through the networks of signaling cascades following their initiation at the cell surface in 
response to RTK stimulation.

Cellular Context

The biological outcome of signals generated at the cell surface in response to RTK 
stimulation is strongly dependent on cellular context. The same RTK will induce a totally
different response when expressed in different cells or at different stages of 
differentiation of a particular cell lineage (Sahni et al., 1999). For instance, in early 
development, FGFR1 plays an important role in control of cell migration, a process 
crucial for mesodermal patterning and gastrulation. Stimulation of FGFR1 in fibroblasts 
on the other hand, leads to cell proliferation while stimulation of FGFR1 expressed in 
neuronal cells induces cell survival and differentiation. The most plausible explanation 
for these observations is that different cells express cell type-specific effector proteins 
and transcription factors that mediate the different responses. According to this view, 
RTKs and their signaling pathways are capable of feeding into multiple processes thus 
regulating the activity of different effector proteins and transcriptional factors in different 
cellular environments. A similar input can therefore generate a different output in a 

different cellular context. In other words, signaling cassettes that are activated by RTKs 
have evolved in order to relay information from the cell surface to the nucleus and other 
cellular compartments irrespective of the biological outcome of their activation.

Finally, there is good evidence that critical signaling cascades are regulated by multiple 
and parallel steps leading to redundancy in signaling pathways. For example, activated 
EGF receptor recruits the adaptor protein Grb2 directly and indirectly via Shc and 
Gab1. Therefore, EGFR mutants defective in Grb2 binding are capable of recruiting the 
adaptor protein Grb2 indirectly resulting in efficient activation of the Ras/MAP kinase 
signaling cascade. Another example is the redundancy seen in the expression and 
function of Src kinases (Klinghoffer et al., 1999). While most cells express at least 
three of the nine known members of the Src family, expression of a single Src kinase 
is sufficient for mediating an intracellular signal that requires a Src family kinase.

Conclusions

It has been 20 years since protein tyrosine phosphorylation was discovered (Hunter and
Sefton, 1980). The last two decades have seen a rapid progress in the characterization 
of protein tyrosine kinases, the signaling pathways they activate, and the mechanisms 
underlying their action and regulation. With the complete determination of the 
sequences of the genomes of C. elegans, Drosophila, and Homo sapiens, the entire 
plethora of kinases, phosphatases, and signaling proteins has become accessible to 
biochemists and geneticists who are interested in deciphering the roles played by RTKs
in normal biological processes and in pathological situations.

It is already clear that signaling pathways activated by RTKs are interconnected with 
other signaling pathways via protein networks that are subjected to multiple positive and
negative feedback mechanisms. The frequently applied tool of targeted gene disruption 
used by geneticists for analyzing signaling pathways is complicated by the existence of 
redundant signaling pathways and because key components are sometimes shared by 
multiple signaling cascades. Consequently, more sophisticated tools should be 
developed and applied for the analysis of cellular signaling pathways. There is need for 
new techniques for determination of protein localization (Teruel and Meyer, 2000) and 
measurement of kinetics of cellular reactions in the context of living cells and even in 
the live animal. In addition, detailed analyses of gene expression patterns by microarray
analysis of genes that are expressed in response to growth factor stimulation 
(Fambrough et al., 1999) of cells derived from normal or pathological tissues will reveal 
new links between signaling pathways. Finally, the modern biochemist and geneticists 
will have to adopt approaches that have been developed by engineers to describe 
complicated networks (e.g., system analysis) in order to obtain a coherent and realistic 
perspective on cell signaling (Levchenko et al., 2000; Jordan et al., 2000).
