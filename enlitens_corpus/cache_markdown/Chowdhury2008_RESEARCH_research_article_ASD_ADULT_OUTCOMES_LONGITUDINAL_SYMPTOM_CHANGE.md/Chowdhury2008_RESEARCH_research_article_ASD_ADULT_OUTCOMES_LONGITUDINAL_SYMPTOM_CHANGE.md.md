DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This 2008 study provides a hopeful, developmental perspective on autism, demonstrating that 
high-functioning autistic adults experience significant positive changes in their traits from 
childhood, with the most substantial gains seen in communication. The research also identifies 
specific social-pragmatic challenges that tend to persist into adulthood, offering a nuanced 
understanding that is crucial for the Enlitens model. Importantly, the study validates the Enlitens 
focus on environment and support by finding a link between receiving childhood therapies and 
achieving better long-term outcomes.

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This research provides critical evidence for a dynamic and non-pathological view of autism, 
directly supporting the Enlitens mission. It demonstrates that an individual's autistic traits are not
a static, lifelong sentence but evolve significantly over time, aligning with our core belief in 
neuroplasticity and the brain's ability to adapt. The findings allow us to offer a more hopeful, 
strengths-based narrative to clients, particularly adults who may feel "stuck." Furthermore, the 
study validates our holistic approach by showing a direct link between environmental supports 
(childhood therapies) and positive adult outcomes, reinforcing that the right support matters 
more than the initial diagnosis.

Key Findings on Adult Autistic Development

This retrospective study of 34 high-functioning autistic adults (mean age 22.5 years) found a 
clear pattern of age-related changes from childhood.

Autistic Traits Improve Significantly Over Time

● Using parent-report data from the ADI-R and SCQ, the study found significant positive 

changes over time across all core domains of autism: Communication, Reciprocal Social
Interaction, and Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors.

● The most substantial gains were made in the

 Communication domain. On the SCQ, 82.35% of subjects showed improvement in 
communication.

Specific Social & Communication Challenges Persist

While overall communication improves, certain nuanced social challenges often continue into 
adulthood.

● A greater proportion of individuals remained symptomatic on ADI-R items related to:

○ Inappropriate questions
○ Inappropriate facial expressions
○ Appropriateness of social responses
○ Use of conventional gestures
○ Range of facial expressions

● A relatively small percentage (17.6%) improved in the area of stereotyped utterances or 
echolalia, which can be a continuing linguistic issue for high-functioning individuals.
● These persistent deficits in observing rules of politeness and expressing appropriate 
emotions contribute to difficulties in forming relationships that require empathy and 
emotional support.

● Reflecting this, only two subjects in the study who lacked peer relationships between 
ages 10 and 15 had successfully developed a reciprocal relationship in adulthood.

Factors Associated with Positive Outcomes

The study identified two key characteristics of the individuals who showed the most 
improvement across all three behavioral domains. This provides powerful evidence for the 
importance of diagnosis and support.

1. Diagnosis: Participants who improved on all three domains were more likely to have an 
Asperger's diagnosis. This is consistent with other research finding that individuals 
who "outgrow" an ASD diagnosis are often those initially diagnosed with Asperger's or 
PDD-NOS.

2. Childhood Support: Improved subjects were also more likely to have received speech,
language, and occupational therapy during childhood. This provides strong support 
for the clinical view that appropriate and timely interventions are related to better long-
term outcomes.

Informing the Enlitens Interview for Adults

The findings from this study can directly inform the questions and validation we provide to adult 
clients.

● We can help clients explore their own developmental trajectory, validating their 

experience of having worked hard to improve communication skills over their lifetime.
● We can normalize the persistence of more subtle social-pragmatic challenges (e.g., 

understanding social appropriateness, navigating reciprocal relationships), which are 
common even in high-functioning adults.

● This research provides a framework for understanding that "improvement" doesn't mean 

"cured" or "no longer autistic," but rather a shift in which traits are prominent.
