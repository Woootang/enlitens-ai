DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This research paper examines the significant heterogeneity within and across 
psychiatric diagnostic categories in the DSM-5. Through a thematic analysis of several 
key chapters, the authors identify inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria related to 
symptom comparison, duration, severity, and the perspective of assessment. The paper
argues that while this flexibility may be pragmatic for clinicians, it undermines the model 
of discrete disorders, obscures the role of causal factors like trauma, and can hinder 
individualized care.

Abstract

The theory and practice of psychiatric diagnosis are central yet contentious. This paper 
examines the heterogeneous nature of categories within the DSM-5, how this 
heterogeneity is expressed across diagnostic criteria, and its consequences for 
clinicians, clients, and the diagnostic model. Selected chapters of the DSM-5 were 
thematically analysed: schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar 
and related disorders; depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; and trauma- and 
stressor-related disorders. Themes identified heterogeneity in specific diagnostic 
criteria, including symptom comparators, duration of difficulties, indicators of severity, 
and perspective used to assess difficulties. Wider variations across diagnostic 
categories examined symptom overlap across categories, and the role of trauma. 
Pragmatic criteria and difficulties that recur across multiple diagnostic categories offer 
flexibility for the clinician, but undermine the model of discrete categories of disorder. 
This nevertheless has implications for the way cause is conceptualised, such as 
implying that trauma affects only a limited number of diagnoses despite increasing 
evidence to the contrary. Individual experiences and specific causal pathways within 
diagnostic categories may also be obscured. A pragmatic approach to psychiatric 
assessment, allowing for recognition of individual experience, may therefore be a more 

effective way of understanding distress than maintaining commitment to a disingenuous 
categorical system.

1. Introduction

Developments and amendments to systems of psychiatric classification can be 
understood within the perspective of wider social and cultural developments (Foucault, 
1967). Amongst other consequences, these socio-political and historical roots have 
resulted in considerable inherent heterogeneity in a wide range of psychiatric 
diagnoses during their piecemeal development. For example, there are stark differences
between highly specific diagnostic criteria and those with more flexibility around 
symptom presentation. As a result, there are almost 24,000 possible symptom 
combinations for panic disorder in DSM-5, compared with just one possible combination
for social phobia (Galatzer-Levy and Bryant, 2013). Olbert and colleagues (2014) also 
report considerable heterogeneity within the criteria of individual diagnoses, showing 
that in the majority of diagnoses in both DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 (64% and 58.3% 
respectively), two people could receive the same diagnosis without sharing any 
common symptoms. Such 'disjunctive' categories have been described as scientifically 
meaningless.

Bannister, for example, pointed out as early as 1968 that the 
'schizophrenia' construct was '[a] semantic Titanic, doomed before it sails, 
a concept so diffuse as to be unusable in a scientific context', largely 
because 'disjunctive categories are logically too primitive for scientific use' 
(Bannister, 1968, pp. 181-182).

Young and colleagues (2014) memorably calculate that in the DSM-5 there are 270 
million combinations of symptoms that would meet the criteria for both PTSD and major 
depressive disorder, and when five other commonly made diagnoses are seen 
alongside these two, this figure rises to one quintillion symptom combinations - more 
than the number of stars in the Milky Way.

Diagnostic heterogeneity is problematic for both research and clinical practice. The 
limitations of focusing research on broad diagnostic categories over specific difficulties 
or distressing experiences are increasingly clear. Research into the relationship 
between childhood abuse and subsequent mental health difficulties is hampered by 
focusing on diagnostic categories (Read and Mayne, 2017), because the associations 
are between specific experiences and symptoms, which disregard diagnostic clusters. 
These associations include, for example, relationships between childhood experiences 
of loss and avoidance/numbing, and between childhood sexual abuse and hyperarousal
(Read and Mayne, 2017). Furthermore, extensive research in psychosis demonstrates 
specific causal pathways, including between childhood sexual abuse and hearing 
voices, and institutionalisation and paranoia (Bentall et al., 2012). Longstanding focus 
on diagnostic categories means that evidence-based recommendations for 
interventions, both drug treatment and psychological therapies, are typically organised 

by diagnosis (e.g. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2005; NICE, 2009),
rather than on specific patterns or presentations of distress, thus recommendations are 
broad brush rather than individualised. The clinical implications of these diagnostically 
focused recommendations are twofold. First, clients may be referred for a brief 
psychological intervention for depression, for example, that follows a low intensity 
cognitive behavioural therapy protocol for depression (NICE, 2009), with little scope for 
individualised adaptations according to the specific difficulties experienced by the client.
Second, clinicians must use alternative methods of clinical decision-making to counter 
the limitations of heterogeneous diagnostic categories. Drug prescriptions are rarely 
made on the basis of a broad diagnosis, but instead according to the specific symptom 
presentation of the client (Taylor, 2016). Similarly, more specialised psychological 
therapy delivered by a clinical psychologist, for example, is guided by nuanced clinical 
formulation. Even psychiatrists may use a 'diagnostic formulation' to further expand 
upon the broad diagnostic category offered.

Diagnostic heterogeneity is considered in this paper within the ways that the formal 
protocol of classification is applied in clinical practice to serve particular functions, and 
the impact that heterogeneity can have in the potential "slippage" (Star & Lampland, 
2009, p. 15) between the two (Suchman, 1987). This study therefore examined the 
sources of heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories. The consequences 
of heterogeneity were investigated; for clinicians, clients, and the theoretical 
conceptualisation of psychiatric diagnoses.

2. Method

For the purposes of manageability, this analysis focussed on five chapters of DSM-5: 
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar and related 
disorders; depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; and trauma- and stressor-
related disorders. These chapters were chosen to reflect commonly reported 
'functional' psychiatric diagnoses as highlighted by the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity 
Survey, including 'common mental disorders', depression- and anxiety-related 
diagnoses (Stansfeld et al., 2016), and PTSD, bipolar, and psychotic disorder 
diagnoses (McManus et al., 2016). One common diagnosis (McManus et al., 2016) that 
is not contained within the included chapters is 'obsessive-compulsive disorder'. 
Although previously listed within anxiety disorders in the DSM-IV-TR (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2000), the DSM-5 lists this diagnosis within its own chapter 
(obsessive-compulsive and related disorders), which contains numerous other 
diagnoses that are new and less common, such as ‘trichotillomania' (hair pulling) and 
'excoriation' (skin picking). This chapter, therefore, was excluded for the purposes of 
this analysis. Childhood diagnoses (e.g. 'reactive attachment disorder'; 'disruptive mood 
dysregulation disorder') were also excluded to enable consideration of diagnostic 
categories with the potential for consistency across assessment and reporting (for 
example, self-reporting of distress).

2.1 Analysis

Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) was used to code themes or patterns of 
meaning across the diagnostic categories being analysed, with a particular focus on the 

heterogeneity or differences across the types of diagnostic criteria. Thematic analysis 
was used to identify the ways in which heterogeneity was represented across 
diagnostic categories, and to organise this heterogeneity into central themes of 
differences across the criteria. The first phase of the analysis focused on identifying 
heterogeneity or differences between the diagnostic criteria of each category within the
five chapters analysed. Four areas of heterogeneity were identified within specific 
diagnostic criteria, and two that spanned across diagnostic categories. During this 
phase of coding, data were extracted from each set of diagnostic criteria in each of the 
five chapters, and coded line by line to the themes above. Subthemes were generated 
from the information within two codes (Standards to which symptoms are compared, 
and Duration of symptoms) as different ways of representing these themes emerged 
across diagnostic categories. The emergent coding framework was reviewed by authors
PK and RC, with the aim of presenting alternative interpretations of the data. The coding
framework was refined accordingly following discussions.

3. Findings

Heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria was found across each of the chapters of the DSM-
5 that were examined; both within specific types of criteria, and more broadly across 
diagnostic categories.

3.1 Heterogeneity within specific diagnostic criteria

3.1.1 The standards to which symptoms are compared

A key element of heterogeneity stems from differences in the comparison of the 
experience of symptoms with subjectively normal or assumed normative functioning (or 
in the omission of such comparators). Diagnostic criteria are represented either by no 
comparator, or a change from previous functioning, behaviour, or mood. In particular, 
some experiences (such as low mood) are seen as problematic only at a particular 
threshold, while other experiences (such as hallucinations) are indicative of disorder by 
their presence alone.

3.1.1.1 Comparisons with prior experience

Most criteria specifying either change or comparisons with prior functioning or 
experience are mood-related (criteria which are also included within the diagnosis of 
schizoaffective disorder). Some descriptions explicitly note a comparison, for example, 
criterion A for a major depressive episode states, "[f]ive (or more) of the following 
symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change 
from previous functioning" (p. 160). Other criteria imply a comparison with previous 
mood, for example, criterion A for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) requires 
"[d]epressed mood for most of the day..." (p. 168); criterion A for a manic episode 
requires "[a] distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or 
irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or 
energy" (p. 124); criteria B2 and B3 for both manic and hypomanic episodes are 
"decreased need for sleep..." and "more talkative than usual..." (p. 124) respectively. 
Each of these implies comparison with a usual or acceptable behaviour or mood, such 
as sleep, which is altered to a problematic extent. Some of the criteria for 

schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia diagnoses also imply a change from 
usual mood or motivation, including 'negative symptoms', described as "diminished 
emotional expression or avolition" (p. 99).

3.1.1.2 Comparison with socially expected responses

Within mood episodes, and criteria for some anxiety and trauma-related diagnoses, 
there is a notion of 'excessive' behaviours or responses, suggesting a comparison with 
a socially expected response. For example, criterion B7 of manic and hypomanic 
episodes requires "excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for 
painful consequences (e.g. engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual 
indiscretions, or foolish business investments)" (p. 124). Criterion B7 of a major 
depressive episode assesses "feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate 
guilt..." (p. 125). Separation anxiety disorder similarly assesses “persistent and 
excessive worry" (A2, p. 190). In another way of assessing a person's response in 
comparison with expected responses, specific phobia and adjustment disorder both 
require the response to be "out of proportion" (pp. 197, 286), with either the object or 
situation (social phobia) or the stressor (adjustment disorder). A subjective judgement is
required to assess whether a person's experiences are out of line with typically 
expected responses. This is discussed further in the theme of 'Perspective from which 
distress is assessed'.

3.1.1.3 No comparators

By contrast, other criteria do not compare symptoms with a person's previous 
experience. This is particularly apparent for 'positive symptoms' of psychosis; the 
presence of delusions and hallucinations, for example, is never stated in diagnostic 
criteria alongside comparison. Non-compared examples from mood disorder diagnoses 
include "feelings of worthlessness” or “recurrent thoughts of death..." (criteria A7 and 
A9, respectively, of a major depressive episode), and "flight of ideas..." or 
"distractibility...” (criteria B4 and B5, respectively, of manic and hypomanic episodes). 
The mood disorders chapters give a mixed presentation of criteria with both 
comparators and no comparators. Three or more of the experiences described in 
criterion B must be present for identification of a manic or hypomanic episode, meaning 
that presentations of these episodes could reflect either discontinuous experiences, 
experiences across a continuum, or a mixture of the two. The criteria for PTSD and 
acute stress disorder notably omit comparators; “[r]ecurrent, involuntary, and intrusive 
distressing memories of the traumatic event(s)" (B1, e.g. p. 271) and "dissociative 
reactions (e.g. flashbacks)..." (B3, e.g. p. 271) are examples of criteria for both these 
diagnoses that are compared with neither expected responses nor prior functioning. By 
not using comparators, these experiences are set up as inherently disordered or 
pathological and so are inconsistent with continuum models of functioning.

The diagnostic criteria for PTSD and acute stress disorder nevertheless require a 
change in thoughts, behaviours and emotions following trauma. The criteria are also 
explicit about the severity of trauma experienced, after which it would be expected that 
most people would experience distress. However, there are no comparators to identify 
what a 'normal' or 'appropriate' response to such a severe stressor would entail. That is,

there is no information about how to identify at what point someone has a 'disordered' 
response as opposed to one that is 'normal'. In the case of the criteria for panic 
disorder, behaviour change related to panic attacks is constructed as unusual or 
unacceptable by what is described as 'maladaptive' criteria, despite this behaviour (such
as “behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks", p. 208) representing attempts to 
cope with the experience of panic attacks.

3.1.2 Duration of symptoms

There were three subthemes representing heterogeneity within the duration of 
symptoms or experiences described by diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5: no duration, 
discrete episodes, and a minimum duration. These timeframes effectively construct 
different 'kinds' of disorder categories.

3.1.2.1 Minimum duration

Most of the analysed diagnostic categories have a minimum duration requirement. For 
example, continuous signs of disturbance for at least 6 months (schizophrenia, 
Criterion C), or at least 2 years of depressed mood (persistent depressive disorder - 
dysthymia - Criterion A). In the absence of other indicators of 'disorder' (such as 
biomedical markers), a minimum duration requirement constructs a definition of 
severity. Giving a minimum duration criterion creates a way of separating between 
'everyday' distress and that which is considered 'clinical', or otherwise abnormal and 
therefore in need of support.

3.1.2.2 No duration

The criteria for certain diagnoses do not use a timeframe. For example, each chapter 
(with the exception of trauma-related disorders) includes difficulties 'due to other 
medical conditions', with no particular duration needed to meet these criteria. These 
diagnoses must be the 'direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical 
condition' (e.g. p. 120). This use of physiological signs set these diagnoses apart from 
other functional diagnoses, suggesting that functional diagnoses use timeframes to 
bolster descriptive diagnoses in the absence of physiological markers. Other diagnoses 
that do not require a particular duration are 'other specified' and 'unspecified' diagnoses 
at the end of each of chapter. These categories have very broad criteria because they 
are specifically included to incorporate difficulties that do not meet the criteria for other 
diagnoses. The experiences have to be characteristic of other diagnoses in their 
chapter, and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning (discussed 
later). However, the 'unspecified' diagnoses do not list any criteria, leaving these 
categories entirely open to clinical judgement. The 'other specified' diagnoses for the 
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders 
and anxiety disorders chapters give options, without durations, for specified difficulties. 
For example, 'persistent auditory hallucinations occurring in the absence of any other 
features', a much briefer criterion than those used for the other diagnoses within the 
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders chapter.

3.1.2.3 Discrete episodes

Least common are diagnoses that represent discrete episodes, with a specific duration 
such as one day to one month (e.g. brief psychotic disorder) or 3 days to 1 month after 
trauma exposure (acute stress disorder p. 281). The symptoms associated with 
adjustment disorders must occur within 3 months of a stressor and not persist for more 
than 6 months "once the stressor and its consequences have terminated" (Criterion E, 
p. 287). These episodic diagnoses suggest either an expectation of an end point that is 
not present for those with a minimum duration, or, more pragmatically, allow difficulties 
to be diagnosed (and treated) before the minimum time period is reached for other 
diagnoses such as PTSD. Bipolar and depressive disorders are treated differently 
again. The bipolar and related disorders chapter (including, e.g. cyclothymia) and the 
category of major depressive disorder are unique in that several episodes are combined
in various ways to produce disorders presented as distinct from one another. Major 
depressive and manic episodes are the two key episodes from which hypomanic 
episode (shorter duration and lesser severity than manic episode) and a mixed features 
specifier (criteria are met for one episode, with features of another during the same 
timeframe) are derived. The three episodes are then variously combined to create eight 
different diagnostic categories (seven bipolar-related diagnoses, and major depressive 
disorder).

3.1.3 Identifiers of severity

In some cases, severity indicators are prioritised over duration requirements, for 
example, where hospitalisation or the presence of psychotic features render 
consideration of duration unnecessary (manic episodes and bipolar and related 
disorders due to another medical condition). Most categories stipulate a criterion of 
"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important 
areas of functioning" (e.g. criterion B, major depressive disorder, p. 161), to establish a 
particular threshold for diagnosis (p. 21). However, the threshold is not defined, and 
therefore represents a subjective judgement, presumably the clinician's. A separate 
concept of a marked change in social, occupational or other areas of functioning 
(schizophrenia; manic episode) allows the criterion to be met in the absence of 
distress. These variations across criteria demonstrate the pragmatic nature of 
diagnostic categories and their use as clinical tools. For example, if a person's 
behaviour is distressing to others, but not to themselves, the clinician has the flexibility 
to override the need for clinically significant distress and make the diagnosis regardless.
DSM-5 contains a dimensional severity rating of 0-4 for each criterion A symptom for 
delusional, brief psychotic, schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder criteria. This 
may, for example, relate to either the pressure to respond to voices or delusions or to 
what extent the individual is bothered by this experience. For other experiences, such 
as disorganised speech, the rating is pragmatically based on clinical observation rather 
than the individual's experience of these difficulties, so that the individual is not required 
to recognise their own disordered speech. Other mood-related diagnoses (bipolar, 
major depression, and related disorders) can be rated using a broad dimensional 
specifier of mild, moderate, severe, or with psychotic features.

3.1.4 Perspective from which distress is assessed

This theme describes the point of view from which distress or other diagnostic criteria 
are assessed, for example, from the account of the individual being assessed, others 
around them (e.g. family or friends), or the assessing clinician. In general, the DSM-5 
represents a shift towards the perspective of the observer, whereas several DSM-IV-TR
diagnoses relied on the individual as the principal (or only) source of information. For 
example, for DSM-IV-TR social phobia (social anxiety disorder in DSM-5), reference is 
made to "marked distress about having the phobia" (criterion E) and that the "person 
recognises that the fear is excessive or unreasonable" (criterion C). In comparison, 
whilst the fears themselves are self-reported in the DSM-5 version of social anxiety 
disorder, the criteria otherwise rely on the perspective of the observer. Represented 
within this shift towards the perspective of the observer is an assumption about insight 
and the capacity to self-report; an assumption frequently associated with psychotic 
experiences. However, this assumption is not explicitly stated in the diagnoses, and 
therefore reinforces the fallacious assumption that all people experiencing mental health
problems tend to 'lack insight'. Thus, the distress criterion is removed and the individual 
need not recognise that their fear is excessive, as the clinician makes this judgement. In
another example, reference to "excessive involvement in activities that have a high 
potential for painful consequences (e.g. engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual 
indiscretions, or foolish business investments)" (manic and hypomanic episodes, p. 124)
constructs a socially accepted level at which the behaviours are considered normal 
versus abnormal. The perspective here demonstrates the power held by the assessing 
clinician (or others, such as family) by virtue of the diagnostic criteria sanctioning the 
making of a value judgement. For other diagnoses, this person's perspective is implied 
but not explicit, for instance, experiences such as distress and distressing memories, 
flashbacks and physiological reactions (PTSD, Criterion B). Finally, in many cases, the 
question of perspective (who is making the judgment as to whether the criterion is met) 
is unambiguously ambiguous, as in the case of major depressive episode; "as indicated 
by subjective report... or observation made by others". In a pragmatic approach, 
information is collected, from a range of sources, to assess whether or not the 
diagnostic criteria are met.

3.2 Wider heterogeneity across diagnostic categories

3.2.1 Symptom overlap across categories

Similar or the same experiences occur in multiple diagnostic categories. Major 
depressive episode, for example, features within the criteria for major depressive 
disorder, bipolar and related disorders, and can be included within the criteria for 
schizoaffective disorder (for which criterion A requires the occurrence of "a major mood 
episode (major depressive or manic)", p. 105). Likewise, hallucinations can occur in 
schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, but also in major depressive disorder 
with psychotic features, bipolar and related disorders (except cyclothymia), and PTSD.

DSM-5 refers to bipolar disorders bridging between psychotic disorders and 
depressive disorders, and likewise that schizoaffective disorder bridges 
several diagnoses. Despite this repetition of experiences, there is no explicit 
statement provided in the DSM about the phenomenological or qualitative 
experience of symptoms across different diagnoses. The DSM-5 

acknowledges, "Although DSM-5 remains a categorical classification of 
separate disorders, we recognize that mental disorders do not always fit 
completely within the boundaries of a single disorder. Some symptom 
domains, such as depression and anxiety, involve multiple diagnostic 
categories and may reflect common underlying vulnerabilities for a larger 
group of disorders..." (p. xli)

Ten specifiers are provided with the DSM-5 to allow the clinician to represent other 
patterns not contained within the main diagnostic criteria for bipolar and major 
depressive disorders, such as with anxious distress, rapid cycling (for bipolar and 
related disorders), or psychotic features. The range of experiences incorporated within 
these specifiers acknowledges the heterogeneity of diagnoses. Depressive episodes 
are no longer required in DSM-5 criteria for bipolar I, and the diagnostic criteria for 
cyclothymic disorder incorporates only experiences that are sub-threshold for both 
hypomania and a major depressive episode. These changes and the additional specifier
of 'anxious distress' for bipolar and MDD diagnoses represents a shift towards 
broadening the range of experiences captured by the same diagnostic labels. The 
'mixed features' specifier further blurs the boundary between depression and bipolar 
diagnoses in that it can be added to episodes of depression within the context of major 
depressive disorder where there are symptoms of mania or hypomania present. 
Likewise, panic attacks can be used as an adjunct to any DSM-5 diagnosis, and 
catatonia can be specified across various diagnoses spanning several chapters 
(including neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, and depressive disorder diagnoses, 
and other medical conditions).

3.2.2 The role of trauma

The DSM-5 states at the outset the atheoretical nature of diagnostic categories, 
however, one chapter of diagnoses is explicitly framed as caused by or directly 
influenced by external factors; trauma- and stressor-related disorders. The 
conceptualisation constructed by this addition of causal information is a notable 
difference from the other analysed chapters. For example, despite PTSD being 
described as a response to an extreme traumatic stressor that would be distressing for 
anyone to experience ("Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual
violence..." criterion A, p. 271), in assigning the diagnosis the individual's response is 
categorised as disordered. A related dilemma can be seen in the remarkable semantic 
similarity between various criteria for schizophrenia and PTSD diagnoses in DSM-5. 
These include affective flattening and avolition, as well as hallucinations, dissociative 
flashback episodes, restricted range of affect, and markedly diminished interest or 
participation in significant activities. All of these experiences would, in the presence of a 
traumatic event, be broadly consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD.

4. Discussion

As the DSM-5 acknowledges that experiences do not always fit within the boundaries of
a specific disorder, its rules are therefore internally inconsistent. The manual presents a 
classification of discrete, homogeneous disorders, yet acknowledges that this structure 

cannot always be followed due to the overlap between diagnostic categories. Much of 
the heterogeneity identified in the above analysis is borne out of pragmatic 
consideration for the application of the DSM-5 into clinical practice. These allowances 
introduce flexibility for the clinician; giving the possibility of categorising extraneous 
symptoms that do not fit neatly within a diagnosis, or identifying experiences or 
behaviours as distressing or disruptive for others despite not necessarily being 
distressing for the individual being assessed. Yet, this heterogeneous flexibility has 
important consequences for the diagnostic classification's model of discrete disorders 
and the way cause is understood.

4.1 Theoretical implications: Threats to the model of discrete disorders

The introduction of methods of clinical flexibility and transdiagnostic clinical features, 
such as 'anxious distress' or 'psychotic features', are contradictory to the DSM-5's 
underpinning model of discrete disorders. Within diagnostic criteria, the same diagnosis 
may be applied in different ways by the clinician to suit individual situations and 
presentations. Whilst clinically practical, such criteria introduce heterogeneity and 
detract from the DSM-5's presentation of diagnoses as rigorously and consistently 
applied criteria that represent stable, homogeneous disorders. In respect of these 
threats to the diagnostic model whereby clinical utility is prioritised over theoretical 
consistency, it would be more useful to adopt an assessment approach that embraces 
this pragmatism, without simultaneously attempting to do this within the confines of a 
strict diagnostic model.

4.2 Clinical implications: Understanding cause

By making reference to trauma or stressors only in one dedicated chapter, the DSM-5 
implies that other diagnostic categories are unrelated to trauma. The consideration of 
social, psychological, or other adversities within diagnoses is therefore minimised; 
symptoms are constructed as anomalous or disordered, rather than potentially 
understandable in relation to a person's life experiences. Even within the trauma- and 
stressor-related disorders chapter, the experiences assessed, despite being specifically 
linked with trauma, are seen as symptomatic of a disordered or inappropriate response 
to that trauma. The reverse of the implications of singling out one trauma-related 
chapter is acknowledged by Spitzer and First; in their response to the suggestion of 
clustering diagnostic categories by cause, they stated:

Most problematic is the characterization of the first cluster as patients with 
"brain disease." Psychiatry has abandoned the reductionist "organic" vs 
"functional" distinction and now regards all mental disorders as disorders of 
brain function. It would be a big leap backward to delineate a subgroup of 
DSM disorders as involving "brain disease" with the implication that in other 
mental disorders brain functioning is unimpaired (Spitzer & First, 2005, р. 
1898).

By the same logic the same can be said of the role of trauma; for the majority of the 
DSM-5 diagnostic categories, the criteria suggest to clinicians that these difficulties are 

caused by the disorder (and implicitly that these disorders are associated with brain 
function), and may therefore limit exploration further than identification of the disorder. 
However, just as Wakefield (2013) describes how stressors other than grief might also 
be related to experiences of low mood and depression, accumulating evidence 
demonstrates that trauma or adversity is involved in the development of many 
conditions and symptoms including psychosis and bipolar disorder (Bentall et al., 2012; 
Palmier-Claus et al., 2016; Varese et al., 2012). Clinical implications may include a 
focus on symptom reduction, on reducing those experiences seen as inherently 
disordered, such as voice hearing, rather than on removing only the distress associated 
with the experiences. In addition, labelling distress as abnormal may in itself create 
further distress. For example, flashbacks in the context of trauma are distressing in 
themselves, but the diagnosis has the potential to make the experience more 
distressing because the flashbacks are regarded as abnormal.

Furthermore, by obscuring heterogeneity within categories, psychiatric diagnoses 
arguably obscure causal heterogeneity or other key differences between individuals 
(Olbert, Gala & Tupler, 2014). Evidence already suggests that there may be distinct 
pathways in the development of specific experiences identified within the diagnostic 
criteria of schizophrenia, for example, strong associations between childhood sexual 
abuse and hallucinations, compared with childhood neglect or institutionalisation and 
paranoia (Bentall et al., 2014). Likewise, in the drive to create unique diagnostic entities 
by separating collections of experiences from each other, potentially important 
similarities in the experiences, or even processes, that exist across diagnoses may be 
lost. An example of this may include similar causal mechanisms for voice-hearing by 
individuals diagnosed with either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (e.g. Hammersley 
et al., 2003).

5. Conclusions

This analysis of chapters of the DSM-5 demonstrates that multiple forms of 
heterogeneity are found across and within diagnostic categories. This heterogeneity 
has important implications for research, clinical practice, and the provision of care that is
specific to a person's individual needs. Pragmatic diagnostic criteria and idiosyncrasies 
offer flexibility for psychiatrists to use 'clinical judgement', but they undermine the model 
of discrete categories of disorder. Yet the diagnostic model still has implications for the 
way that cause is understood; limited reference to trauma implies that it affects only a 
limited number of diagnoses, despite increasing evidence to the contrary. Furthermore, 
by focusing on diagnostic categories, individual experiences of distress and specific 
causal pathways may be obscured.

A pragmatic approach to psychiatric assessment, which allows for 
recognition of individual experience, may therefore be a more effective way 
of understanding distress than maintaining a commitment to a disingenuous 
categorical system.
