DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a foundational scientific review from the journal Cell, titled "Signaling Takes 
Shape in the Immune System." It details the complex, multi-step process of T cell activation, 
focusing on the formation of the "immunological synapse"—a highly organized structure at the
interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The paper explains how this 
synapse integrates signals from T cell receptors (TCRs), adhesion molecules, and the 
cytoskeleton to control the immune response. It highlights the importance of molecular 
patterning, membrane domains (like GEMs or lipid rafts), and cytoskeletal dynamics in setting 
the activation thresholds that prevent both autoimmunity and infection.

Signaling Takes Shape in the Immune 
System

Introduction

The adaptive branch of the immune system is built on the principle that the enemy can take any 
shape or form, but will display different protein sequences from the host. A highly flexible 
mechanism has evolved to recognize foreign protein segments based on a developmentally 
programmed series of transient cell-cell synapses between T cells armed with T cell antigen 
receptors (TCR) and antigen-presenting cells (APC) decorated with peptide ligands.

The activation of the mature T cell requires interaction of the TCR and MHC-peptide 
complexes in a specially organized cell-cell junction between the T cell and the APC that has 

been aptly described as an immunological synapse. The physical interaction of TCR with 
MHC-peptide complexes is unique among signaling systems in that it takes place over a 
continuum of kinetic parameters with different sensitivity thresholds at different points in 
development.

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of cell asymmetry, cytoskeletal 
dynamics, membrane organization and molecular patterning in setting thresholds 
for the T cell activation process.

Shortly after contact between the T cell and APC, a bull's-eye pattern forms... Over a period of 
minutes this bull's-eye inverts resulting in a mature immunological synapse characterized by a
central group of activated TCRs (the central supramolecular activation cluster or cSMAC) 
that is surrounded by a large ring of adhesion receptors (the peripheral supramolecular 
activation cluster or pSMAC). Maintenance of this stable bull's-eye pattern correlates well with
multiple parameters of effective activation of the T cell and the immune response.

Steps of Physiological T Cell Activation

The current paradigm for physiological T cell activation can be broken down into several steps:

1. T Cell Polarization: T cells are first polarized and attracted to potential APC by 

chemoattractants.

2. Adhesion: Polarized T cells enter into non-antigen-specific adhesion with the APC. 

Adhesion receptors bring TCR and MHC into proximity.

3. TCR Engagement: The TCR is then engaged by MHC-peptide complexes.
4.

Immunological Synapse Formation: If the interaction exceeds thresholds, signaling 
and synapse formation are initiated.

5. Stabilization: The synapse must be stabilized for several hours for full T cell activation.
6. Termination: The synapse is disassembled, and the T cell migrates away.

The Cytoskeletal Renaissance

An important building block of the immunological synapse are components of the 
cytoskeleton. Models for TCR collaboration with actin have been profoundly influenced by a 
recent surge in understanding of how surface receptors are linked to actin polymerization. 
These studies have identified a common pathway for actin polymerization based on recruitment 
and activation of the Arp2/3 complex to the membrane surface, often involving proteins like 
WASP (the protein deficient in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome).

Excitement about Membrane Domains

Membrane domains have become a focus in many areas of cell biology. A particularly 
interesting type of membrane domain termed membrane rafts, detergent insoluble domains 
(DIGs), or glycolipid enriched microdomains (GEMs) is relatively ordered compared to the bulk 
of the plasma membrane. This domain is enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and a 
variety of acylated cytoplasmic proteins. Many important molecules in T cell signaling are 
localized to these domains. One current idea is that the GEMs are very small in resting cells 
and may readily coalesce during signaling in response to receptor crosslinking.

Step 4: TCR Signaling and Immunological Synapse Formation

Engagement of the TCR by MHC-peptide leads to the assembly of signaling complexes, 
generates multiple second messengers, and induces cytoskeletal changes required to stop the 
migration of the T cells (the stop signal). Generation of these second messengers involves the 
sequential activation of three distinct families of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs)—the Src, 
Syk, and Tec families.

The enzymatic activities of these three PTK families are required to phosphorylate a growing 
number of linker proteins that function as scaffolds to localize and assemble signaling 
complexes. Most notable are the SH2-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) and 
the transmembrane Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT).

Step 5: Stabilization

Duration of signaling is also a critical parameter for T cell activation. The maintenance of the 
immunological synapse over many hours may be promoted by molecular changes during its 
maturation. For example, the recruitment of more rigid lipid rafts (GEMs) to the T cell and APC 
sides of the synapse may contribute to stabilization. Stabilization of phosphotyrosine signals has
been associated with the recruitment of GEMs to the interface between T cells and anti-TCR 
coated beads triggered by coligating the costimulatory molecule CD28.

While providing a more rigid platform, the GEMs may also help organize competing 
or antagonistic pathways to sustain TCR signaling and maintenance of the 
immunological synapse. The localization of signaling complexes to these 
microdomains may sequester them from negative regulatory proteins, such as 
protein phosphatases including CD45.

Conclusions

Focusing on the individual steps of physiological T cell activation allows application of a number 
of genetic and biochemical studies on model systems to be applied to understanding the 
integrated process of T cell activation. The determinants of this process appear to regulate the 
interaction of signals and morphogenic processes such as actin polymerization and myosin II 
activation in the synapse.

Is the bull's-eye pattern of the immunological synapse (Figure 1B) the 
supramolecular shape of things to come in signaling? While the concept of the 
synapse is over a hundred years old, studies in both the nervous system and 
immune systems on molecular organization of synapses are just beginning. It is 
likely that many surprises are still in store.
