DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper provides an essential cognitive psychological framework for understanding the 
pragmatics of swearing, making it a critical resource for Enlitens' goal of using strong language 
tactfully. The authors argue that the purpose of swearing is primarily emotional expression and 
its appropriateness is not universal but is highly dependent on context, including the speaker-
listener relationship, the social setting, and the specific word used. This research offers a 
practical guide for how Enlitens can strategically use swearing to convey authenticity and 
frustration with the current system, while avoiding being perceived as merely impolite or 
unprofessional.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "The main purpose of swearing is to express emotions, especially anger and frustration."
● "Swearing is the use of taboo language with the purpose of expressing the speaker's 

emotional state and communicating that information to listeners."

● "We believe that swearing is not necessarily impolite, inasmuch as offensive language is

often used within the boundaries of what is considered situationally appropriate in 
discourse; further, some instances of swearing are neither polite nor impolite."

● "From what we have observed, we argue that swearing can be polite, impolite, or neither

and it may be used with any emotional state."

● "Field studies of swearing... have demonstrated that swearing in public is not an 

infrequent act, and most instances of swearing are conversational; they are not highly 
emotional, confrontational, rude, or aggressive."

● "A common problem for impoliteness, rudeness, and swearing research is that all three 
phenomena are impossible to define universally because all are culturally and personally
determined."

● "What is impolite cannot be universally construed, since impoliteness depends on the 

relationship between speaker and listener."

● "We propose that people have context-sensitive knowledge of swearing appropriateness

that amounts to the rules for swearing or the etiquette of swearing."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Function and Nature of Swearing

● Primary Purpose: Swearing's main purpose is to express emotions, particularly anger 
and frustration. It serves to communicate the speaker's emotional state to listeners.
● Connotative Meaning: Swear words are primarily meant to convey connotative or 

emotional meaning, as opposed to literal, denotative meaning.

● Propositional vs. Nonpropositional Swearing:

○ Propositional Swearing: This is consciously planned, intentional, and controlled
by the speaker. It can be polite (e.g., "This pie is pretty fucking good!"), rude 
(e.g., "You fucking asshole!"), or neither. This is the category of swearing 
Enlitens would use strategically.

○ Nonpropositional Swearing: This is unintentional, unplanned, and 

uncontrollable, often occurring as an automatic emotional response (e.g., to 
surprise or pain) or due to brain damage. It is not considered polite or impolite, as
the offense is unintentional.

Swearing and (Im)politeness

● Not Inherently Impolite: The authors argue against the simplistic view that swearing is 
always rude. Instead, its politeness is judged based on what is appropriate for a given 
situation.

● Situational Appropriateness: Generally speaking, swearing is appropriate and not 
impolite amongst peers in casual settings. In formal contexts and with participants of 
unequal status, swearing is not expected or appropriate.

● Strategic Rudeness: Drawing on Beebe (1995), the paper notes that people can be 
intentionally rude to obtain power or vent negative feelings. Swearing can be used for 
"strategic rudeness".

● "Politic" Behavior: Swearing may be considered "politic" (appropriate) in a given 

situation, and not merely polite or impolite.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: A Guide to 
Tactful Swearing for Enlitens

This research provides a clear "etiquette of swearing" that Enlitens can use to ensure its 
language is perceived as authentic and powerful, rather than simply offensive.

Rule 1: Master the Contextual Variables

The appropriateness of swearing is dictated by a combination of factors. Before using a swear 
word, consider:

● The Specific Word: All taboo words are not equal. The study used three tiers:

○ High Taboo: cocksucker, cunt, fuck
○ Medium Taboo: bastard, goddamn, piss
○ Low Taboo: crap, hell, idiot

 The choice of word dramatically impacts perceived offensiveness.

● The Speaker-Listener Relationship:

○ Status: Higher status individuals (e.g., a dean) are expected to swear less than 

lower status individuals. A high-status speaker swearing is rated as more 
offensive. For Enlitens, tactfully breaking this rule could signal a rejection of 
establishment norms.

○ Gender: Men are expected to swear more than women, and men use more 

offensive language, especially in the company of other men. Both genders are 
more likely to swear in same-sex contexts. For native English speakers, women 
tend to rate swearing as more offensive than men do.

○ Friendliness & Credibility: People are more persuaded by friends. A target 

person was liked less when described with a swear word by a "best friend" than 
by a "worst enemy". Receiving verbally aggressive messages from friends is 
more hurtful than from acquaintances.
 Application: By establishing a friendly, peer-like rapport with its audience, 
Enlitens' use of strong language against the "enemy" (the testing establishment) 
will be more credible and persuasive.

● The Social-Physical Setting:

○ Formality: People are more likely to swear in relaxed, informal environments 

than in formal ones.

○ "Turf": Appropriateness depends on who "owns" the space. It is more 

appropriate for a dean to swear in their own office than elsewhere on campus. 
Conversely, it is highly inappropriate for a student to swear in a dean's office but 
entirely appropriate in a dorm room.

Rule 2: Use Swearing for Pro-Social or Strategic Purposes

● Promote Social Harmony ("Face Building"): Swearing can be used to build rapport 
and express positive emphasis, which is perceived as polite. Example: "This is pretty 
fucking good!". Enlitens can use this to build community and express passionate support
for its mission and clients.

● Vent Strong, Authentic Emotion: The primary purpose of swearing is to express 

emotion. Using it to convey genuine frustration with a broken system can be perceived 
as cathartic and authentic rather than rude.

● Employ "Strategic Rudeness": Swearing can be used as a tool of instrumental 

aggression to intimidate or gain power. Enlitens can use strong language to attack the 
"face" of the testing industry, strategically positioning itself as a powerful and unafraid 
challenger.

Rule 3: Understand the Audience's Experience

● The Learning Curve: It takes time and cultural experience for speakers to learn the 
nuanced rules of swearing. Young children and non-native speakers require time to 
attain an adult native speaker's knowledge of what is offensive.

● Emotional Impact Varies: The perceived emotional force of swear words is highest in 

one's native language. Non-native speakers with less experience in a language show 
lower autonomic nervous system reactivity to taboo words and rate them as less 
offensive.

● Nuance vs. Offensiveness: The study found that non-native speakers are aware of the 
general offensiveness of taboo language but are less aware of how context moderates 
that offensiveness (sociopragmatics). Native speakers showed a wider, more variable 
range in their ratings, indicating a more nuanced, context-dependent understanding.
