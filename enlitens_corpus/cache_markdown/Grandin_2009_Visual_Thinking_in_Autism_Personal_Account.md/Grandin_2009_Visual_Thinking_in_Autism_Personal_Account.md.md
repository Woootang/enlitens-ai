# Extracted Text for Grandin_2009_Visual_Thinking_in_Autism_Personal_Account.md.pdf

DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This is a powerful first-person account by Dr. Temple Grandin describing her cognitive process 
as a "photo-realistic visual thinker." She explains that her mind operates like an internet search 
engine for images, where all thoughts are pictures and language serves as a narrator. This 
document is essential for Enlitens as it provides a vivid, lived-experience illustration of 
neurodiversity, demonstrating a valid and highly effective "bottom-up" thinking style that 
contrasts with typical linear thought. Grandin also proposes a groundbreaking model of three 
distinct specialized thinking types in autism (visual, pattern, and verbal), underscoring the need 
for individualized, strengths-based assessment and directly critiquing the validity of standard IQ 
tests like the Wechsler scales.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"My mind is similar to an Internet search engine that searches for photographs. I use language 
to narrate the photo-realistic pictures that pop up in my imagination."

"When I design equipment for the cattle industry, I can test run it in my imagination similar to a 
virtual reality computer program."

"All my thinking is associative and not linear."

"All my thinking is bottom-up instead of top-down. I find lots of little details and put them 
together to form concepts and theories."

"Since my mind stores information as photo-realistic pictures, I do not have true abstract 
thinking. To visualize the concept of my future after high school, I had to use door symbols."

"I have concluded that there are three principal types of specialist thinking."

"Dawson and colleagues found that the IQ scores for the autistic children were 30-70 percentile 
points higher on the Raven's compared with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 
(WISC), while normal children have similar IQ scores when given the Raven's and the WISC."

"These results show that autistic intelligence is truly different."

"In my case, abstract thought based on language has been replaced with high-speed handling 
of hundreds of 'graphics' files."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Raven's vs. Wechsler IQ: Citing the work of Dawson et al. cite_start, Grandin notes that
IQ scores for autistic children were 30 to 70 percentile points higher on the Raven's 
Progressive Matrices compared to the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). 
In contrast, non-autistic children score similarly on both tests.

● Brain Imaging (Personal): Dr. Grandin reports that a diffusion tensor imaging scan 
performed on her in https://www.google.com/search?q=2006 by Nancy Minshew and 
colleagues revealed a "huge white fibre tract that runs from deep in my visual cortex up 
to my frontal cortex." She states it is "almost twice as large as my sex- and age-matched
controls."

● Brain Imaging (General): Citing Kana et al. cite_start, Grandin notes that functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that in people with autism, 
word-based tasks are processed in the visual parts of the brain.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Three Types of Specialized Autistic/Asperger Thinking Based on her experiences and 
interviews, Temple Grandin proposes a model of three distinct cognitive types within the autism 
spectrum.

● (i) Photo-realistic visual thinkers: This is the category Grandin places herself in.

○ Cognition: All thoughts are in photo-realistic pictures. Thinking is associative, 
not linear. Concepts are formed by sorting specific pictures into categories.
○ Strengths: Design, mechanics, and any work requiring visualization. They can 

"see everything in my head and then draw it on paper."
○ Weaknesses: Algebra, because it cannot be visualized.

● (ii) Pattern thinkers music and math mind: This is described as a more abstract form 

of visual thinking.

○ Cognition: Thoughts are in patterns rather than photo-realistic pictures. These 

thinkers see patterns and relationships between numbers.

○ Strengths: Excelling in math and music.
○ Weaknesses: May have problems with reading or writing composition.

● (iii) Verbal specialists / Word fact thinkers: This type excels in verbal domains.

○ Cognition: Possess a huge memory for verbal facts on a wide variety of topics.
○ Strengths: Good at talking and writing.

○ Weaknesses: Often poor at drawing and other visual thinking skills.

Bottom-Up, Associative Thinking Grandin describes her primary cognitive process as bottom-
up and associative.

● Process: She gathers many small, specific pieces of data (visual images from 

experience or reading) and puts them together to form concepts and theories, much like 
completing a jigsaw puzzle without knowing the final picture. This contrasts with top-
down thinking, where one starts with a theory and fits data into it.

● Concept Formation: Concepts are formed by sorting photo-realistic pictures into 

categories based on shared sensory features. For example, she learned to differentiate 
dogs from cats by identifying a specific visual feature (nose shape) that all dogs share, 
regardless of size.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

This entire document is a detailed account of a specific autistic cognitive style—photo-realistic 
visual thinking. It provides a rich, qualitative description of how this neurotype experiences the 
world, processes information, and solves problems.

● Associative Memory: Grandin describes how memories are accessed in a non-linear, 
associative web. The word "butterfly" triggers a sequence of images from butterflies in 
her yard, to decorative metal butterflies, to a painting she did, to a "butterfly cut of 
chicken" from a recent meal.

● Visual Symbols for Abstract Concepts: Lacking "true abstract thinking," Grandin 
explains that as a teenager, she had to use concrete visual symbols, like doors she 
could walk through, to conceptualize her future.

● Lifelong Development: She notes that her cognitive and social abilities improved 
significantly with age, particularly between 40 and 60, as her mental "database" of 
images and experiences grew. This contradicts the notion that development ceases after
childhood.

● Uneven Profile of Abilities: The model of three specialized thinkers directly addresses 
the "uneven profile of abilities" found in many autistic individuals, explaining it as a trade-
off where specialization in one area comes at the expense of others.

ASSESSMENT CRITIQUE

Grandin provides a strong critique of traditional intelligence testing and advocates for alternative
methods that recognize different cognitive styles.

● Wechsler IQ Tests: Grandin explicitly supports the research of Michelle Dawson and 
Laurent Mottron showing that Wechsler IQ tests are inappropriate for many autistic 
individuals. She cites their finding that autistic children score 30-70 percentile points 
higher on the Raven's Progressive Matrices, a non-verbal pattern-reasoning test.

● Raven's Progressive Matrices: Grandin explains that this test is more suitable because
it involves identifying the pattern that completes a complex series, a task that aligns with 
the pattern-thinking strengths of some autistic individuals.

● True Intelligence is Different: She concludes from this research that "autistic 

intelligence is truly different" and not adequately captured by traditional, often language-
heavy, IQ tests.
