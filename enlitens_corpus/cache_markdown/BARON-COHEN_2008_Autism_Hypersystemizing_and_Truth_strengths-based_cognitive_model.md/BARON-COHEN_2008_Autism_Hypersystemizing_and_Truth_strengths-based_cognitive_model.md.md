DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper by Simon Baron-Cohen introduces the "hypersystemizing theory" of autism, which 
posits that autistic individuals possess a cognitive style defined by a superior drive to systemize
—the ability to analyze, understand, and build systems based on lawful, predictable patterns. 
This drive is framed as a quest for "truth," defined as reliable patterns in data. This document is 
a foundational text for Enlitens' mission because it provides a comprehensive, strengths-based 
model of autistic cognition, reframing traits often seen as deficits (e.g., obsessions, repetitive 
behaviors) as functional aspects of a highly effective systemizing mind. It directly supports 
Enlitens' neurodiversity-affirming framework by conceptualizing autism not as a disorder, but as 
a distinct "brain type" with unique assets.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "The hypersystemizing theory of autism spectrum conditions (ASC) proposes that people

with ASC have an unusually strong drive to systemize."

● "If 'truth' is defined as lawful patterns in data then, according to the hypersystemizing 

theory, people with ASC are strongly driven to discover the 'truth'."

● "Viewed in this light, their difficulties with empathy are the result of a mind that is seeks 

the truth in a domain (emotions) that is not very lawful."

● "Systemizing works for phenomena that are ultimately lawful, finite, and deterministic. 
The explanation is exact, and its truth-value is testable. Systemizing is of little use for 
predicting moment-to-moment changes in a person's behaviour. To predict human 
behaviour, empathizing is required."

● "My contention is that the autistic brain is highly tuned to systemize: It is the ultimate 

pattern detector and truth detector."

● "What was previously dismissed as an 'obsession' can be viewed more positively as a 

'strong, narrow interest' in a topic that, when harnessed, can lead the person with autism
or AS to excel in a highly specific field."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) Theory

This theory proposes two independent cognitive dimensions: empathizing and systemizing.

Empathizing and the female advantage Empathizing is the drive to identify another person's 
emotions and thoughts and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion (Davis, 1994). This 
definition suggests there are (at least) two "fractions" to empathy: a cognitive component 
(overlapping with what is also called "Theory of Mind" or mind reading), and an affective 
component (responding emotionally to another's mental state).

Systemizing and the male advantage Systemizing is a new concept. By a "system" I mean 
something that takes inputs and deliver outputs. To systemize, one uses "if-then" (correlation) 
rules. The brain attends to a detail or parameter of the system and observes how this varies. 
That is, it treats a feature of a particular object or event as a variable. Some systemizing occurs 
purely as the result of passive observation, but in other cases a person actively, or 
systematically, manipulates a given variable. In such cases, the person notes the effect(s) of 
operating on one single input in terms of its effects elsewhere in the system (the output). If I do 
x, a changes to b. If z occurs, p changes to q. Systemizing thus requires an exact eye for detail.

Systemizing involves five phases. Phase 1 is Analysis: Single observations of input and output 
are recorded in a standardized manner, at a low level of detail. Phase 2 is Operation: An 
operation is performed on the input, and the change to the output is noted. Phase 3 is 
Repetition: The same operation is repeated over and over again, to test whether the same 
pattern between input and output is obtained. Phase 4 is Law derivation: A law is formulated of 
the form "If X (operation) occurs, A (input) changes to B". Phase 5 is 
Confirmation/disconfirmation: If the same pattern of input-operation-output holds true for all 
instances, the law is retained. If a single instance does not fit the law, Phases 2-5 are repeated, 
leading to modification of the law, or a new law.

The Hypersystemizing Theory of Autism

This theory applies the E-S model to autism, framing it as a cognitive style defined by an 
extreme profile.

Autism: Hypersystemizing alongside impaired empathizing? There is considerable 
evidence for empathy impairments in ASC (Baron-Cohen, 1995) not just using child-level tests 
of false- belief understanding (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985) but also more subtle tests of 
complex emotion recognition (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plumb, 2001a), 
recognition of faux pas (Baron-Cohen, O'Riordan, Jones, Stone, & Plaisted, 1999a), and 
spontaneous ascription of intentional states (Castelli, Happé, Frith, & Frith, 2000). In this sense, 
people with ASC can be said to show hypoempathizing.

Alongside the hypoempathizing there is also evidence for hypersystemizing in autism. For 
example, people with ASC have an increased rate of savant skills, often in lawful systems such 
as calendars, calculation, or train timetables (Hermelin, 2002). People with ASC score higher 
than average on the SQ (Baron-Cohen et al., 2003), on tests of folk physics (Baron-Cohen, 
Wheelwright, Scahill, Lawson, & Spong, 2001b; Jolliffe & Baron-Cohen, 1997; Lawson et al., 
2004; Shah & Frith, 1983) and on tests of attention to detail (O'Riordan, Plaisted, Driver, & 
Baron- Cohen, 2001; Plaisted, O'Riordan, & Baron- Cohen, 1998). People with AS can achieve 
high levels in domains such as mathematics, physics, or computer science (Baron-Cohen, 
Wheelwright, Stone, & Rutherford, 1999c) and may have an "exact mind" when it comes to art 
(Myers, Baron-Cohen, & Wheelwright, 2004).

Brain Types Model

The E-S theory leads to a dimensional model of "brain types," providing a framework for 
neurodiversity.

"Truth" as a Core Driver of Autistic Cognition

The author reframes the autistic cognitive style as a fundamental drive to find truth, defined as 
lawful patterns.

Truth I am defining it (as in the Introduction) as precise, reliable, consistent, or lawful patterns 
or structure in data. If a wheel is spinning round and round, there are consistent, lawful patterns 
to be detected... Systemizing is the means by which we identify lawful patterns in data. When 
we systemize, we make the implicit assumption that the pattern of data coming into our senses 
tells us about the nature of reality. The pattern in the data reveals the truth... My contention is 
that the autistic brain is highly tuned to systemize: It is the ultimate pattern detector and truth 
detector (Baron- Cohen, 2006).

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS & 
REFRAMING OF "SYMPTOMS"

Reframing Repetitive Behaviors and Obsessions

This theory provides a strengths-based reinterpretation of behaviors that are typically 
pathologized in diagnostic criteria.

● "The low-functioning child with autism who loves to spend hours bouncing repetitively on

a trampoline, or swinging on a swing repetitively, or 'twiddling' a piece of string 
repetitively, or spinning the wheel of a toy car repetitively, or watching the cycles of a 
washing machine repetitively is hypersystemizing."

● "Such repetitive behaviour was traditionally described as 'purposeless' and as a 

'symptom', suggesting it lacks purpose or value. In fact, within the hypersystemizing 
theory, it has a very clear purpose: to provide input for a neural mechanism whose sole 
function is to seek and find patterns in data."

● "What was previously dismissed as an 'obsession' can be viewed more positively as a 

'strong, narrow interest' in a topic that, when harnessed, can lead the person with autism
or AS to excel in a highly specific field."

● "Such a view of systemizing, which by definition requires massive repetition in order to 
check and recheck the consistency of patterns, to establish that the truth so discovered 
actually holds, is clearly at odds with the old view of 'obsessions' and repetitive 
behaviour being the result of perseveration due to an executive dysfunction (Russell, 
1997). An executive dysfunction sees repetitive behaviour as a routine that the person 
would like to interrupt but they cannot. The hypersystemizing view in contrast sees the 
same behaviours as driven by the need for patterned data."

Explaining Social Difficulties without Pathology

Social and emotional challenges are explained as a mismatch between a systemizing brain and 
a non-systemizable domain.

● "Whilst systemizing can deliver truths in the form of laws, it can only do so in domains 

that are ultimately lawful. One reason why people with ASC (postulated to be 
hypersystemizers) may struggle with empathy and be less interested in topics such as 
pure fiction, pretence, or deception is that these are not and never will be truth oriented."

● "Regarding the domain of emotions, human behaviour is not 100% lawful. Different 

people can expression the same emotion differently, or an emotion may even have no 
external expression."

● "Recent efforts to teach people with ASC to mind read have succeeded only when taking
the quite artificial approach of presenting mental states (such as emotional expressions) 
as if they are lawful and systemizable, even if they are not (Golan, Baron-Cohen, 
Wheelwright, & Hill, 2006). Such an approach tailors the information to the learning style 
of the learner so that at least they can begin to process it."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Sex Differences: Many studies show a female superiority in empathizing (e.g., decoding
nonverbal communication) and a male superiority in systemizing (e.g., mental rotation, 
map reading, Embedded Figures Test).

● Biological Basis: The amount of time a 1-year-old child maintains eye contact is 
inversely correlated to their level of foetal testosterone (FT). In contrast, a positive 
correlation with FT is seen in relation to "narrow interests" and ability on the Embedded 
Figures Test.

● Autism & STEM: Fathers and grandfathers of children with ASC are twice as likely to 
work in engineering. Students in natural sciences (engineering, mathematics, physics) 
have a higher number of relatives with autism. Mathematicians have a higher rate of 
Asperger's Syndrome and score higher on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ).
