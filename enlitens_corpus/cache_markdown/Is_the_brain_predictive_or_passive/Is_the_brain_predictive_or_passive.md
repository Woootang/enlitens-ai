Yes, the brain is fundamentally predictive—it actively generates and tests
hypotheses about the world, rather than being a passive processor of sensory
input.

1. Introduction

A major paradigm shift in neuroscience over the past two decades has reframed the brain from a passive receiver

of sensory information to an active, predictive organ. The predictive processing framework posits that the brain

continuously generates internal models to anticipate incoming sensory input, updating these models based on the

difference between predictions and actual input (prediction error) (Picard & Friston, 2014; Clark, 2015; Bar, 2007;

Engel et al., 2001; Ohira, 2024; Smith et al., 2020; Friston, 2018; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Teufel & Fletcher,

2020; Hutchinson et al., 2019; Pezzulo et al., 2021; Sprevak & Smith, 2023; Siman-Tov et al., 2019; Schrimpf et al.,

2020; Richter et al., 2017; Bastos et al., 2020; Blom et al., 2020; Friston, 2019; Miller & Clark, 2018; Mavroudis et al.,

2023; Rao, 2024; Heeger, 2017; Smout et al., 2019; Allen & Friston, 2016; Kveraga et al., 2007; Muñoz-Caracuel et

al., 2024). This approach, often called predictive coding or active inference, is now supported by converging

evidence from neuroimaging, computational modeling, electrophysiology, and clinical research. While some

feedforward, stimulus-driven (passive) processing occurs, the dominant view is that perception, action, and

cognition are fundamentally shaped by top-down predictions and the minimization of prediction error (Picard &

Friston, 2014; Clark, 2015; Bar, 2007; Engel et al., 2001; Ohira, 2024; Smith et al., 2020; Friston, 2018; Keller &

2016; Kveraga et al., 2007; Muñoz-Caracuel et al., 2024). This review synthesizes the evidence for predictive versus

passive models of brain function.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The Deep Search process involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8

thematic clusters, focusing on predictive processing, passive/feedforward models, computational and

philosophical perspectives, neural mechanisms, and clinical implications. In total, 1,033 papers were identified, 683
were screened, 565 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Predictive Processing: The Dominant Framework

•

Predictive coding and active inference: The brain is described as a "prediction machine," constantly generating
hypotheses about sensory input and updating them based on prediction errors (Picard & Friston, 2014; Clark,

2015; Bar, 2007; Engel et al., 2001; Ohira, 2024; Smith et al., 2020; Friston, 2018; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018;

Teufel & Fletcher, 2020; Hutchinson et al., 2019; Pezzulo et al., 2021; Sprevak & Smith, 2023; Siman-Tov et al.,
2019; Schrimpf et al., 2020; Richter et al., 2017; Bastos et al., 2020; Blom et al., 2020; Friston, 2019; Miller &

Clark, 2018; Mavroudis et al., 2023; Rao, 2024; Heeger, 2017; Smout et al., 2019; Allen & Friston, 2016; Kveraga

et al., 2007; Muñoz-Caracuel et al., 2024).

•

Hierarchical models: Predictions are generated at multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy, with higher areas

sending predictions to lower areas, and lower areas sending back prediction errors (Engel et al., 2001; Keller &

Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Teufel & Fletcher, 2020; Siman-Tov et al., 2019; Schrimpf et al., 2020; Richter et al., 2017;
Bastos et al., 2020; Chao et al., 2018; Friston, 2019; Rao, 2024; Heeger, 2017; Smout et al., 2019; Allen & Friston,

2016; Kveraga et al., 2007; Muñoz-Caracuel et al., 2024).

•

Empirical support: Neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and computational modeling show that expected stimuli
evoke reduced neural responses, while unexpected stimuli (prediction errors) evoke stronger responses (Engel

et al., 2001; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Richter et al., 2017; Bastos et al., 2020; Blom et al., 2020; Friston, 2019;

Smout et al., 2019; Muñoz-Caracuel et al., 2024).

2 / 10

3.2. Passive/Feedforward Models: Historical Perspective and Limitations

•

•

Feedforward models: Earlier models viewed the brain as a passive, stimulus-driven device, with information

flowing from sensory organs through a series of feature detectors (Engel et al., 2001; Walsh et al., 2020; Keller &
Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Teufel & Fletcher, 2020; Rao, 2024; Heeger, 2017).

Limitations: These models struggle to explain phenomena such as perceptual illusions, context effects, and the

brain's ability to anticipate and prepare for future events (Picard & Friston, 2014; Clark, 2015; Bar, 2007; Engel et
al., 2001; Ohira, 2024; Smith et al., 2020; Friston, 2018; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Teufel & Fletcher, 2020;

Hutchinson et al., 2019; Pezzulo et al., 2021; Sprevak & Smith, 2023; Siman-Tov et al., 2019; Schrimpf et al.,

2020; Richter et al., 2017; Bastos et al., 2020; Blom et al., 2020; Friston, 2019; Miller & Clark, 2018; Mavroudis et
al., 2023; Rao, 2024; Heeger, 2017; Smout et al., 2019; Allen & Friston, 2016; Kveraga et al., 2007; Muñoz-

Caracuel et al., 2024).

3.3. Hybrid and Context-Dependent Models

•

•

Hybrid models: Some recent work suggests the brain can flexibly combine predictive (top-down) and passive

(bottom-up) processing, depending on context, familiarity, and task demands (Tschantz et al., 2022; Rao, 2024;

Heeger, 2017).

Feedforward sweeps: Rapid, feedforward processing may dominate for highly familiar or simple stimuli, while

recurrent, predictive processing is engaged for ambiguous or novel input (Tschantz et al., 2022; Rao, 2024;
Heeger, 2017).

3.4. Clinical and Evolutionary Implications

•

•

Clinical relevance: Failures in predictive processing are implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders,

including schizophrenia, autism, and persistent physical symptoms (Picard & Friston, 2014; Henningsen et al.,

2018; Smith et al., 2020; Teufel & Fletcher, 2020; Pezzulo et al., 2021; Siman-Tov et al., 2019; Allen & Friston,

2016).

Evolutionary perspective: Predictive mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved and have been elaborated from

simple homeostatic loops to complex, hierarchical generative models (Pezzulo et al., 2021; Rao, 2024; Heeger,
2017).

4. Discussion

The predictive processing framework is now the dominant model in cognitive neuroscience, supported by

extensive empirical and theoretical evidence (Picard & Friston, 2014; Clark, 2015; Bar, 2007; Engel et al., 2001;

Ohira, 2024; Smith et al., 2020; Friston, 2018; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Teufel & Fletcher, 2020; Hutchinson et

al., 2019; Pezzulo et al., 2021; Sprevak & Smith, 2023; Siman-Tov et al., 2019; Schrimpf et al., 2020; Richter et al.,

2017; Bastos et al., 2020; Blom et al., 2020; Friston, 2019; Miller & Clark, 2018; Mavroudis et al., 2023; Rao, 2024;

Heeger, 2017; Smout et al., 2019; Allen & Friston, 2016; Kveraga et al., 2007; Muñoz-Caracuel et al., 2024). The

brain is not a passive recipient of sensory data; rather, it actively constructs perception, action, and cognition by
generating and updating predictions. This approach explains a wide range of phenomena, from perception and

motor control to language, emotion, and clinical disorders (Picard & Friston, 2014; Clark, 2015; Bar, 2007; Engel et

al., 2001; Ohira, 2024; Smith et al., 2020; Friston, 2018; Keller & Mrsic-Flogel, 2018; Teufel & Fletcher, 2020;

Hutchinson et al., 2019; Pezzulo et al., 2021; Sprevak & Smith, 2023; Siman-Tov et al., 2019; Schrimpf et al., 2020;

Richter et al., 2017; Bastos et al., 2020; Blom et al., 2020; Friston, 2019; Miller & Clark, 2018; Mavroudis et al., 2023;

Rao, 2024; Heeger, 2017; Smout et al., 2019; Allen & Friston, 2016; Kveraga et al., 2007; Muñoz-Caracuel et al.,
2024). While some feedforward, stimulus-driven processing remains, especially for simple or familiar stimuli, the

bulk of evidence supports a fundamentally predictive brain.

Hybrid models acknowledge that the brain can flexibly shift between predictive and passive modes depending on
context, but even these models emphasize the primacy of prediction in most cognitive functions (Tschantz et al.,

2022; Rao, 2024; Heeger, 2017). Failures in predictive processing are increasingly recognized as central to various

neuropsychiatric conditions (Picard & Friston, 2014; Henningsen et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2020; Teufel & Fletcher,

2020; Pezzulo et al., 2021; Siman-Tov et al., 2019; Allen & Friston, 2016).

5. Conclusion

The weight of current evidence strongly supports the view that the brain is fundamentally predictive, actively
generating and updating models of the world to guide perception, action, and cognition, rather than passively

processing sensory input.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite the dominance of predictive processing models, open questions remain about the precise neural
