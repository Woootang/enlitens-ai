Yes, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is crucial for overriding existing
beliefs when presented with strong evidence by supporting belief updating,
cognitive control, and flexible decision-making.

1. Introduction

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is a central hub for executive functions, including cognitive control,

working memory, and adaptive decision-making. A growing body of research demonstrates that the dlPFC plays a

pivotal role in overriding existing beliefs when individuals are confronted with strong, contradictory evidence. This

process involves integrating new information, suppressing prior biases, and flexibly updating internal models of the

world (Bartolo & Averbeck, 2020; Schulreich & Schwabe, 2020; Benoit et al., 2015; Presti et al., 2025; Jamali et al.,

2019; Baumgartner et al., 2011; Prado & Noveck, 2007; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Chawke & Kanai, 2016; Parris et al.,

2009; Panidi et al., 2022; Aydogan et al., 2018; Dixon & Christoff, 2014; Xia et al., 2021; Kobayashi et al., 2021;

Carter & Veen, 2007; Gerchen et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2020; Philiastides et al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2020; Wang et al.,

2023). Both neuroimaging and causal intervention studies (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, tDCS) show that

dlPFC activity increases during belief revision, especially under uncertainty or when prior beliefs are challenged

(Bartolo & Averbeck, 2020; Schulreich & Schwabe, 2020; Baumgartner et al., 2011; Prado & Noveck, 2007; Chawke

& Kanai, 2016; Parris et al., 2009; Panidi et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022; Xia et al., 2021; Carter & Veen, 2007;

Philiastides et al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023). The dlPFC interacts with other prefrontal and

cingulate regions to detect conflict, accumulate evidence, and implement top-down control, enabling individuals
to adaptively revise beliefs and make decisions aligned with new evidence (Bartolo & Averbeck, 2020; Schulreich &

Schwabe, 2020; Baumgartner et al., 2011; Prado & Noveck, 2007; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Chawke & Kanai, 2016;

Parris et al., 2009; Panidi et al., 2022; Dixon & Christoff, 2014; Xia et al., 2021; Carter & Veen, 2007; Philiastides et

al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023). This review synthesizes the literature on the dlPFC’s mechanisms
in belief updating and highlights its importance for rational thought and behavioral flexibility.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across more than 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search targeted the dlPFC’s role in belief updating, cognitive

control, and overriding prior beliefs in the face of strong evidence. In total, 1001 papers were identified, 609 were
screened, 293 were deemed eligible, and the 46 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. dlPFC and Belief Updating Under Uncertainty

The dlPFC is consistently activated during tasks requiring belief updating, especially in uncertain or changing
environments. Causal studies using tDCS and TMS demonstrate that stimulating the right dlPFC enhances

normative belief updating and adaptive decision-making, supporting a direct role in integrating new evidence and

revising prior beliefs (Bartolo & Averbeck, 2020; Schulreich & Schwabe, 2020; Baumgartner et al., 2011; Chawke &
Kanai, 2016; Panidi et al., 2022; Philiastides et al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023).

3.2. Cognitive Control and Conflict Resolution

The dlPFC is engaged when individuals must override automatic or habitual responses, resolve conflict between

prior beliefs and new evidence, and inhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias or belief perseverance (Prado

& Noveck, 2007; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Chawke & Kanai, 2016; Parris et al., 2009; Aydogan et al., 2018; Dixon &
Christoff, 2014; Xia et al., 2021; Carter & Veen, 2007; Gerchen et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2020). Neuroimaging studies

show increased dlPFC activity during logical reasoning, conflict detection, and tasks that require breaking away

from perceptual or belief-based cues (Prado & Noveck, 2007; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Chawke & Kanai, 2016; Parris
et al., 2009; Aydogan et al., 2018; Dixon & Christoff, 2014; Xia et al., 2021; Carter & Veen, 2007; Gerchen et al.,

2024; Lin et al., 2020).

2 / 9

3.3. Flexible Decision-Making and Value Integration

The dlPFC supports flexible decision-making by dynamically integrating task-relevant information, updating value

representations, and guiding choices that deviate from prior expectations when warranted by new evidence
(Bartolo & Averbeck, 2020; Schulreich & Schwabe, 2020; Jamali et al., 2019; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Panidi et al.,

2022; Dixon & Christoff, 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020). Single-neuron and population-level

recordings reveal that dlPFC activity tracks subjective value, evidence accumulation, and the transition between
belief states (Bartolo & Averbeck, 2020; Jamali et al., 2019; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2021; Lin et al.,

2020).

3.4. Individual Differences and Network Interactions

Individual differences in dlPFC structure and function predict the ability to update beliefs and resist bias (Turnbull

et al., 2019; Presti et al., 2025; Jamali et al., 2019; Aydogan et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2017). The

dlPFC interacts with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and other
regions to coordinate cognitive control, conflict monitoring, and belief revision (Prado & Noveck, 2007; Donahue &

Lee, 2015; Chawke & Kanai, 2016; Parris et al., 2009; Dixon & Christoff, 2014; Xia et al., 2021; Carter & Veen, 2007;

Gerchen et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports a central role for the dlPFC in overriding existing beliefs when presented with

strong evidence. The dlPFC enables flexible updating of internal models by integrating new information,

suppressing prior biases, and exerting top-down cognitive control (Bartolo & Averbeck, 2020; Schulreich &

Schwabe, 2020; Baumgartner et al., 2011; Prado & Noveck, 2007; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Chawke & Kanai, 2016;

Parris et al., 2009; Panidi et al., 2022; Dixon & Christoff, 2014; Xia et al., 2021; Carter & Veen, 2007; Gerchen et al.,

2024; Lin et al., 2020; Philiastides et al., 2011; Qureshi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023). Causal intervention studies
confirm that dlPFC stimulation enhances belief updating and adaptive decision-making, while disruption impairs

these processes (Schulreich & Schwabe, 2020; Chawke & Kanai, 2016; Panidi et al., 2022; Philiastides et al., 2011;

Qureshi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023). The dlPFC’s function is supported by its interactions with other prefrontal

and cingulate regions, forming a network for conflict detection, evidence accumulation, and behavioral adaptation

(Prado & Noveck, 2007; Donahue & Lee, 2015; Chawke & Kanai, 2016; Parris et al., 2009; Dixon & Christoff, 2014;

Xia et al., 2021; Carter & Veen, 2007; Gerchen et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023). However, some

studies highlight individual variability and context dependence, suggesting that dlPFC contributions may be
modulated by task demands, emotional salience, and personal relevance (Turnbull et al., 2019; Presti et al., 2025;

Jamali et al., 2019; Aydogan et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2017). Methodological limitations include

variability in stimulation protocols, task designs, and the challenge of isolating dlPFC-specific effects from broader

executive networks.
