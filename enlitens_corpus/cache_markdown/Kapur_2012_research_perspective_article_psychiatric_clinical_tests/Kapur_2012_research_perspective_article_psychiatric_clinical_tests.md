DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a perspective article by Kapur, Phillips, and Insel (2012) that critically 
examines why biological psychiatry has failed to produce clinically useful diagnostic 
tests for mental disorders. The authors argue that this failure stems from systemic 
issues: the lack of a biological "gold standard" for DSM-defined illnesses, a 
proliferation of underpowered studies with small effect sizes, "approximate 
replications" that fail to confirm or refute findings, and a focus on clinically irrelevant 
comparisons between prototypical patients and healthy controls. As a solution, they 
propose a shift away from diagnosing DSM categories and toward "stratified 
psychiatry"—using biomarkers to identify biologically homogenous subtypes that cut 
across traditional diagnoses to better predict outcomes and guide treatment.

Why has it taken so long for biological psychiatry to 
develop clinical tests and what to do about it?

S Kapur, AG Phillips and TR Insel

PERSPECTIVE

Patients with mental disorders show many biological abnormalities which distinguish 
them from normal volunteers; however, few of these have led to tests with clinical utility.
Several reasons contribute to this delay: lack of a biological 'gold standard' definition of
psychiatric illnesses; a profusion of statistically significant, but minimally differentiating, 
biological findings; 'approximate replications' of these findings in a way that neither 
confirms nor refutes them; and a focus on comparing prototypical patients to healthy 
controls which generates differentiations with limited clinical applicability.

Overcoming these hurdles will require a new approach. Rather than seek 
biomedical tests that can 'diagnose' DSM-defined disorders, the field should 

focus on identifying biologically homogenous subtypes that cut across 
phenotypic diagnosis—thereby sidestepping the issue of a gold standard.

To ensure clinical relevance and applicability, the field needs to focus on clinically 
meaningful differences between relevant clinical populations, rather than hypothesis-
rejection versus normal controls. Validating these new biomarker-defined subtypes will 
require longitudinal studies with standardized measures which can be shared and 
compared across studies—thereby overcoming the problem of significance chasing and
approximate replications. Such biological tests, and the subtypes they define, will 
provide a natural basis for a 'stratified psychiatry' that will improve clinical outcomes 
across conventional diagnostic boundaries.

INTRODUCTION

Biological psychiatry aims to understand mental disorders in terms of the biological 
function of the nervous system. By several measures it has been a tremendous 
success... Despite these successes, it has not led to clinical tests that can be routinely 
used in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. In the early 2000s, a series of 
white papers expressed hope that the advances in genetics, imaging and new 
technologies might lead to a biologically supported psychiatric classification and 
diagnostic system. But a decade later, as we stand at the threshold of a new version of 
the DSM, there are few biological clinical tests central to diagnosing psychiatric 
illnesses (other than those used to exclude physical illnesses). This article explores why
this journey has been difficult for psychiatry and what can be done about it.

THE MISSING GOLD STANDARD

To create a biological test to assist in the diagnosis of an illness one needs a stable and
biologically valid concept of the illness. As the standardised classification systems have 
been constantly revised (from ICD-6 to ICD-10 and from DSM-I to DSM-IV), they have 
remained a descriptive taxonomy based on expressed feelings and observed behaviour.
On the one hand, these successive editions of DSM and ICD lead to increasing 
psychometric precision. On the other hand, the ever increasing fractionation of mental 
distress into smaller and more numerous categories, without a priori biological validity, 
makes it harder to find specific biomedical tests that diagnose or predict the disorders.

Thus, psychiatry seems to be in a Catch-22: the current diagnostic system 
was not designed to facilitate biological differentiation and it does not. The 
biological studies to date have not been able to propose a clinically viable 
alternative system.

This lack of a gold standard, and the consequent circularity, is not unique to 
psychiatry. A number of disorders in physical medicine defy simple biological definitions.
Breast lumps were categorised based on different symptoms and clinical courses, until 
histopathological differentiation and molecular markers turned them into distinct 
illnesses.

SIGNIFICANCE CHASING WITH UNDERPOWERED STUDIES

The vast majority of biological findings in psychiatry are of a small or moderate effect 
size—even though many of them survive the 'P<0.05' test of statistical significance. 
Although these risks are not unique to biological psychiatry, it is particularly vulnerable 
to 'significance chasing' because the studies in this field generally tend to be 
underpowered, have small sample sizes, measure multiple dimensions and use 
subjective outcomes. Chasing small effects with underpowered studies has meant that 
even though the field has led to a large output of publications, there are few findings 
with effect-sizes large enough that could be converted into clinical tests.

APPROXIMATE REPLICATIONS

One might expect that failure to replicate the findings would induce scientists to lose 
interest... Unfortunately, an initial underpowered study is often followed by another 
study of similar size but with a few additional measures and variables to give it some 
novelty and distinction. These subsequent studies usually have only modest statistical 
power to decisively confirm or refute the original finding, but do have sufficient 
multiplicity of new measures to generate some significant finding—even though not 
precisely the one observed in the first study—thus providing an 'approximate 
replication'. As a result, the 'literature' in the field grows without decisively 
replicating/rejecting the precise original finding, but instead creates a penumbra of 
"P<0.05" findings around the first.

EXTREME COMPARISONS

Nonetheless, some biological findings have stood the test of time and replication, and 
have reasonably large effect sizes... However, these large differences have been noted 
mostly in studies comparing prototypical patients versus picture-perfect healthy controls.
Clinically, one is rarely taxed with distinguishing a textbook patient from a perfectly 
healthy individual. The real challenge is in distinguishing those who demonstrate the 
superficially similar symptoms that may merit rather different treatments and outcomes. 
Experience in the rest of medicine shows that the predictive value of a biological 
differentiator decreases as we move from extreme contrasts to more clinically relevant 
ones.

FROM SUBTYPES TO 'STRATIFIED MEDICINE'—THE PLAUSIBLE
GOAL FOR PSYCHIATRY

A more feasible opportunity for psychiatry, as for the rest of medicine, is 'stratified 
medicine': the identification of biomarkers or cognitive tests that stratify a broad-illness
phenotype into a finite number of treatment-relevant subgroups.

Progress in oncology illustrates this approach well: overexpression of human epidermal 
growth factor subtype 2 (HER2) in breast cancer tissue was first identified as a subtype 
with a poor prognosis. As the differential biology of this subtype was better understood, 
it led to the development of monoclonal antibody therapies (trastuzumab or Herceptin) 
which increased long-term survival for this particular subtype of breast cancer.

This approach to 'stratified medicine' has several important lessons for psychiatry: 
First, it bypasses the nosological debates about the precise diagnostic boundaries and 
does not need an external 'gold standard', as the approach justifies itself by its utility. 
Second, stratification does not require a complete understanding of aetiology. Third, 
one does not have to wait for new treatments to arrive. Finally, these tests become 
useful in clinical medicine across diagnoses without requiring wholesale diagnostic 
reclassification.

Thus, in a 'stratified psychiatry', these tests could coexist alongside the 
conventional diagnostic systems (such as DSM5 or ICD11). The patients 
could be first diagnosed along conventional grounds, but then stratified by 
markers that predict prognosis or suggest differential treatments.

STRATIFIED PSYCHIATRY—IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW DATA 
ARE COLLECTED AND SHARED

For the last three decades, the majority of the grants and papers in biological psychiatry
had three characteristics: strict allegiance to a DSM or ICD diagnoses; focus on 
differentiation of patients with the diagnoses from normal controls; and usually a short-
term cross-sectional evaluation. Stratified psychiatry will require a change in this 
mind-set.

The field will have to collect data across the current diagnostic categories, 
focus on comparing across disorders as much as comparing versus normal 
controls and will need to collect and curate data, so that it can be widely 
shared and collated.

The National Institutes of Mental Health... has already initiated such an approach... The 
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) is an approach that attempts to link behavior and 
cognitive symptoms to the underlying neurobiological systems and genetic 
predispositions in a way that cuts across the categories within the current diagnostic 
systems.

CONCLUSION

Biological psychiatry and the related neurosciences have changed mankind's view of 
itself and of mental illness, but have yet to provide biomedical tests for routine clinical 
practice. The delay is understandable... On the other hand, the opportunity afforded by 
the progress in genomics and imaging combined with the computational abilities is 
unprecedented and could deliver useful clinical tests. These tests will identify 
homogenous populations for whom one could develop targeted new therapeutics thus 
realising a vision of a new stratified psychiatry that cuts across the traditional 
diagnostic boundaries while simultaneously transforming them.
