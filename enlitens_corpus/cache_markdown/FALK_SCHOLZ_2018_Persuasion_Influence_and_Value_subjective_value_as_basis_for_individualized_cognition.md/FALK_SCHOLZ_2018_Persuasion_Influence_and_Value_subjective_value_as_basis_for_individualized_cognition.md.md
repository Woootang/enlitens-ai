DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This review, "Persuasion, Influence, and Value," synthesizes communication science and social 
neuroscience to argue that a single, core mechanism underlies persuasion and social influence:
subjective valuation. The paper posits that all decisions—whether to share information or to 
be influenced by it—are driven by the brain's value system (primarily the VMPFC and ventral 
striatum) calculating the expected value of an action for the individual. This framework is 
foundational for Enlitens' mission because it provides a robust neuroscientific model that 
invalidates the premise of standardized testing. It demonstrates that cognition is not objective 
but is fundamentally shaped by person-specific, context-dependent factors like self-relevance 
and social relevance, providing a powerful argument for assessment methods like clinical 
interviews that aim to understand an individual's unique internal value system and motivations.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "In this review, we argue that the diverse set of thought processes that determine what 
information communicators share... and whether receivers are influenced... do so via a 
common pathway, namely subjective value maximization."

● "Valuation involves explicitly and implicitly weighing perceived costs and benefits to 

derive the value of choices or actions and has been conceptualized as a motivating force
for action... In other words, people make choices to maximize the value they expect from
their actions."

● "This neural perspective suggests that brain systems that calculate subjective value 

represent a final common pathway or common currency through which different decision
alternatives... can be reconciled, prioritized, and realized in behavior and preferences."

● "Given the wide range of dimensions that inform the expected costs and benefits of a 

decision, it can be difficult for individuals to self-report on the exact processes that lead 
to their choices. Neuroimaging provides a method of simultaneously measuring and 
quantifying a wide range of possible input dimensions to the subjective value calculation 
and, thereby, provides a different perspective on decision making processes."
● "[M]otivations to share... and to update attitudes and behaviors in response to 

persuasion and social influence... often occur automatically, outside of conscious 
awareness."

● "Studies of argument quality similarly suggest that people are persuaded less by facts 

and more by subjective value: '[T]he persuasive impact of argument quality, as it has 
been operationalized, is much less about logic than it is about valence. That is, 
persuasion is more about suggesting good rather than bad consequences (valence) for 
the message recipient than it is about creating impeccably logical—a.k.a. truthful or likely
—arguments' (Johnson et al. 2004, p. 216)."

● "On average, self-related entities are judged to be disproportionately valuable and things

or concepts perceived to be valuable are readily attributed to the self."

● "In sum, self-disclosure might be inherently valuable to communicators and engages 

neural systems similar to those engaged by monetary rewards."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Subjective Value as a Common Pathway for Influence

The central argument is that all forms of persuasion and social influence operate through the 
brain's general-purpose value system. This system acts as a "common currency" to weigh the 
costs and benefits of different options, unifying diverse social phenomena under the single 
principle of value-based decision making.

● The Brain's Value System: Activity within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) 
and ventral striatum (VS) integrates various inputs into a common value signal. This 
signal allows for comparison between different choices (e.g., sharing information, taking 
the stairs) on a common scale to inform actions. This system is not specific to one type 
of choice and responds to both primary (food) and secondary (money) rewards.

● Reconceptualizing Persuasion: Prior theories in persuasion and communication have 
implicitly focused on maximizing subjective value. This framework makes the connection
explicit, linking psychological models to the neuroscientific literature on valuation. It 
treats persuasion as an input to a value calculation that determines whether a receiver 
changes their attitudes or behaviors.

● Reconceptualizing Communication: Decisions to share information are framed as 

attempts to maximize the expected value to the communicator, with a particular focus on
anticipated social rewards (e.g., impression management, social bonding).

● Reinforcement and Social Learning: The value signal is updated via reinforcement 

learning, tracking the difference between expected and actual outcomes. An action that 
produces a better-than-expected outcome (e.g., social approval from sharing an article) 
is reinforced and more likely to be repeated. This same principle applies to social 
learning, where observing the outcomes of others' actions updates one's own value 
calculations. Conformity to group norms is a central, valued commodity that is reinforced
through this system.

Key Inputs to Subjective Value: Self and Social Relevance

The framework highlights two primary inputs that consistently modulate the brain's value 
computation in the context of social influence: self-relevance and social relevance.

● Self-Relevance: Information that relates to a person's self-concept, identity, and goals is

processed as more valuable.

○ Neural Overlap: Brain regions involved in processing self-relevance (medial 

prefrontal cortex, MPFC; posterior cingulate cortex, PC/PCC) strongly overlap 
with regions involved in valuation (VMPFC).

○ Effect on Receivers: Self-relevance motivates deeper processing of arguments, 
leading to more durable attitude change. People are more favorable to ideas that 
align with their self-interest. Manipulations that increase self-relevance, like 
tailoring messages or using self-affirmation, increase VMPFC activity and 
subsequent behavior change.

○ Effect on Communicators: People are more likely to share self-relevant 

content. The act of self-disclosure is itself intrinsically rewarding and activates the
brain's value system much like a monetary reward.

● Social Relevance (Mentalizing): Considering the mental states of others (theory of 

mind/mentalizing) is a key input to the value calculation for social decisions.

○ Neural Systems: Mentalizing is supported by a network including the 

temporoparietal junction (TPJ), temporal lobes, and dorsomedial prefrontal 
cortex.

○ Effect on Communicators: People show greater activity in the mentalizing 

system when deciding whether to share information with others. More successful 
persuaders (e.g., salespeople) show greater activity in mentalizing regions.
○ Effect on Receivers: Conformity is driven by the desire for social approval and 
bonding. Brain activity in the mentalizing system is associated with a greater 
likelihood of conforming to group feedback.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

Limitations of Self-Report and the Advantage of Neuroimaging

The paper argues that neuroimaging offers a unique advantage over traditional self-report 
methods because many of the underlying processes of influence are not consciously 
accessible.

● Implicit Processes: It can be difficult for individuals to self-report on the exact 

processes that lead to their choices. Motivations to share information and to update 
attitudes in response to social influence often occur automatically and outside of 
conscious awareness.

● Real-Time, Unfiltered Measurement: Neuroimaging provides a method to measure and
quantify a wide range of inputs to the subjective value calculation in real time as they 
happen. This measurement occurs without requiring the participant to consciously reflect
on the processes, making the evidence agnostic to whether the processes are 
consciously accessible.

● Predictive Power: Neural activity (specifically in the VMPFC and VS) has been shown 
to predict large-scale, population-level outcomes (e.g., success of antismoking ad 
campaigns, music sales, click-through rates on health articles) better than participants' 
own self-reports of liking or intentions.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

Developmental Differences (Adolescents)

The review highlights that the neural mechanisms of social influence may operate differently in 
adolescents compared to adults, suggesting that a single model of influence is insufficient 
across different developmental stages.

● Divergent Responses to Peer Opinions: While studies in adults often show decreased

value-related activity when disagreeing with a group, two studies focusing on 
adolescents reported greater activity in parts of the value system during exposure to 
divergent peer opinions. This raises the question of whether developmental changes 
alter the relationship between value system activity and social influence.

● Susceptibility to Influence: In teens, greater activity in the mentalizing system when 

disagreeing with group feedback was associated with a higher likelihood of conforming 
to that feedback. Another study found that teens who showed more global coupling 
between mentalizing regions and the rest of the brain during social exclusion also 
showed greater susceptibility to peer influence in a later driving task.

● Popularity Tracking: Initial studies document the role of the brain's value system in 
processes relevant to communication, such as tracking popularity within a social 
network.

Cultural and Environmental Differences

The paper explicitly calls for more research into how culture and environment shape the neural 
bases of persuasion, arguing that current findings are likely not universal.

● Call for Research: "Additional research is also needed to determine the extent to which 
the findings described above apply across cultures, socioeconomic circumstances, and 
developmental stages."

● Differential Weighting: The authors propose that "value, self, and social processes may
be given relatively different weights according to cultural background, environmental 
constraints, and developmental stage."

● Preliminary Evidence: The authors cite preliminary evidence suggesting that "social 
influence may operate differently in the brain depending on cultural variables such as 
socioeconomic background (Cascio et al. 2017)."

● Future Directions: The paper concludes that understanding how culture influences the 
neural bases of persuasion and how these processes might vary in cross-cultural or 
intergroup communication settings is critical.
