DOCUMENT SUMMARY This meta-narrative review analyzes seven distinct research traditions
concerning the collaborative relationship between professionals and parents of children with 
neurodisability. It highlights the historical and systemic tensions between paternalistic, medical-
model approaches and empowering, family-centered philosophies rooted in social justice and 
critical disability studies. The paper provides substantial evidence of the gap between policy 
ideals and lived experience, critiquing systems that devalue parental knowledge and enforce 
neurotypical norms, which directly supports Enlitens' mission to challenge traditional paradigms.

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is a foundational text for our work. It systematically breaks down the history of 
thought around neurodisability services, providing a rich, citable evidence base for our core 
arguments. It validates our stance against paternalistic, deficit-focused models by showing how 
they create conflict and fail families. The review's focus on "paradigm shifts," the "professional 
dilemma," and the critique of "normative" goals provides the academic and historical context for 
why the Enlitens revolution is both necessary and timely. It directly contrasts the 
medical/functionalist paradigm with the social/structural paradigm, giving us powerful language 
and concepts to use in our whitepaper and marketing.

Critical Insights & Arguments for Our Work

● The "Identity Crisis" in Services: Disability services are in an "identity crisis" 

navigating debates about inherent ableism in their practices, which is the perfect 
opening for Enlitens to present a new model.

● Critique of Normative Bias: Relationship-focused therapies are questioned for 

selecting child outcomes that follow a "normative, neurotypical bias (e.g., focusing on 
social engagement, sitting still)" , and for using assessment tools that reinforce 
"unconscious ethnocentrism." This is a direct attack on standardized, normative 
approaches.

● Systemic Failure: There is a persistent gap between the "work as imagined" (family-
centered policy) and "work as done" (professional-led, deficit-focused practice). 
Research shows "highly significant differences between parents' actual roles in therapy 
and the ideal roles."

● The Parent Paradox: Parents must simultaneously "complying with' and 'adapting to' 

disability services, whilst also 'negotiating' and 'resisting'" to get care while maintaining a 
positive disability identity for their child. This perfectly describes the struggle our clients 
face.

● Professionals as Gatekeepers: Social policy forces professionals into a "gatekeeper" 
role for allocating finite resources , creating a conflict between what's best for the 
individual and the needs of the population they serve. This explains why even well-
meaning professionals can't provide the care families need within the current system.

● Devalued Knowledge: Institutions create "'buried and disqualified' knowledge, an 

undervaluing of the knowledge which parents bring", a core problem Enlitens solves by 
centering lived experience.

Quotes We Might Use

● On Unsatisfactory Encounters: "Many parents view these encounters as 
unsatisfactory, citing a failure of professionals to listen to their perspectives."

● On the System's "Identity Crisis": "Many disability services are currently experiencing 
what could be described as an 'identity crisis' as they navigate these growing debates 
about ableism viewed to be inherent in practice."

● On Resisting Professional Dominance: Parent activism can be seen as "resistance to 
the 'professional appropriation of parenthood' a social phenomenon occurring throughout
the 20th Century."

● On the Professional Dilemma: Professionals may experience "a moral anxiety due to 
conflicting responsibilities and roles between 'benefits for all' versus 'best outcomes for 
the individual'."

● On Neurotypical Bias: "A second concern, in the light of evolving understandings about
neurodiversity, is the selection of desired child outcomes which follow a normative, 
neurotypical bias (e.g., focusing on social engagement, sitting still)."

● On the Unattainable Ideal: "Following 40 years of family-centred practice, questions 

remain as to whether family-centred services are deliverable or remain an unattainable 
ideal."

● On the Cause of Conflict: "Dialogue and discussion about conceptualisations of 

children's disability should explore why consideration of both strengths and impairments 
can lead to conflict between parents and professionals."

Alternative Approaches Mentioned

● Meta-Narrative Review: The methodology itself is useful, as it traces the history and 
conflicts between different scientific paradigms rather than just aggregating data. This 
allows for a deeper critique of the system.

● Critical Disability Studies: This tradition is explicitly named and used to critique policy 

and the construction of "normal" development.

● Systems Theory (Social-Ecological Model): Challenges the validity of treating a child 
in isolation, acknowledging family and wider environmental influences. It moves from a 
pathology-focused view to a humanistic view of interdependent families.

● Community Psychology (Empowerment Model): Focuses on empowerment as both a
process and outcome that "enables marginalised people to gain control and autonomy 
over their lives." The professional's role is to
 promote the parent's agency.

● Parent Coaching: Contrasted with "parent training," coaching is a "collaborative 
reciprocal process involving cycles of action or practice, self- reflection, and self-
correction" where goals are "primarily articulated by the parent."

Developing Collaborative Relationships between 
Professionals and Parents of Children with 
Neurodisability: A Meta-Narrative Review

Abstract

Purpose of Review Parents of children with complex neurodisabilities have multiple encounters
with healthcare and disability professionals. Many parents view these encounters as 
unsatisfactory, citing a failure of professionals to listen to their perspectives. This meta-narrative
review provides a novel synthesis of the research traditions examining parent-professional 
collaboration. This re-evaluation of collaborative relationships is timely given current dialogues 
within children's services in response to evolving understandings of disability and neurodiversity.

Recent Findings Seven research traditions are described with roots in: social justice, social 
ecology and sociology, community psychology, adolescent psychiatry, special education, 
cultural anthropology, and critical disability studies.

Summary This review highlights several 'mixed messages' arising between policies and 
experiences which can create discord between parents and professionals; along with 
institutional contexts which prohibit relationship building. Flexible and responsive services are 
challenging to deliver yet co-developed interventions which value parents' knowledge and skills 
are an important driver for institutional and policy change.

Introduction

In this meta-narrative review , we explore collaboration between healthcare and disability 
professionals and parents of children with neurodisability. The term 'parent' is used throughout 
this review to refer to a child's primary family caregivers or paid carers fulfilling the parent role. 
The term neurodisability "describes a group of congenital or acquired long-term conditions that 
are attributed to impairment of the brain and/or neuromuscular system and create functional 
limitations.... The impact may include difficulties with movement, cognition, hearing and vision, 
communication, emotion, and behaviour" Our review focuses on children with neurodisability 
described as having complex medical needs or chronic care needs ; numbers of whom are 
rising due to medical advances in the survival of vulnerable infants as well as improved 
diagnosis. These children are typically under the care of multiple healthcare professionals. In 
addition, children with neurodisabilities are reliant on a range of supports provided by family 
members. Parents are responsible for embedding therapeutic interventions in their child's 'real 
world' through structured practice or generalisation to natural activities.

In defining and delivering such interventions, the relationship between parents and 
professionals relies on collaboration; a concept which remains poorly defined. Definitions 
typically encompass two distinct aspects: relational practices such as active listening and the 
development of rapport, and participatory practices such as agreeing goals, planning therapy, 
and obtaining resources and supports. In this paper, our working definition of collaboration is the
process whereby parents and professionals work together with a common aim; and which 

requires the development of a therapeutic relationship and partnership where power, 
responsibility, and decision making are shared based on knowledge and expertise.

Current dialogues within and about children's services are driven by greater understandings of 
disability/difference and neurodiversity, initiated by disability advocacy movements and critical 
disability scholarship. Many disability services are currently experiencing what could be 
described as an 'identity crisis' as they navigate these growing debates about ableism viewed to
be inherent in practice. Such evolving attitudes and beliefs have an impact on parent-
professional relationships which has yet to be explored in the literature. Recent reviews are 
limited in scope when examining the complexity of parent-professional relationships in 
healthcare and disability services.

In this review, we adopted meta-narrative review methodology drawing on Kuhn's writings. Kuhn
proposed that science advances not in a cumulative fashion, but via shifts in scientific 
paradigms. When a paradigm shifts, received wisdom is abandoned in favour of a new scientific
explanation. Paradigm shifts give rise to new research traditions. In the field of disability 
services and research, such a shift focused on the neurodiversity paradigm (credited to Walker, 
2011) is currently being debated. This review is, therefore, timely in addressing how 
collaboration with parents may be viewed in the light of changing attitudes and roles. Our 
research questions are derived from meta-narrative review methodology.

In this review we aim to identify paradigms and research traditions and to examine how 
researchers working within each tradition, have approached the topic of collaboration in 
childhood neurodisability. Specifically, our research questions are:

1. Which research traditions address the collaborative relationship between healthcare and
disability professionals, and parents of children and adolescents with neurodisabilities?
2. How have researchers conceptualised collaborative relationships between professionals 

and parents in terms of their philosophical assumptions and the methodological 
traditions used to investigate them?

3. How have researchers within each tradition sought to identify or capture what constitutes

a successful or unsuccessful relationship between healthcare and disability 
professionals and parents?

Parent narratives: Tales of Resistance and Resolution

This research tradition foregrounds the narrative discourses of parents with disabled children. 
Many of these parents were also professionals working in the sphere of childhood disability and 
embodied the challenges inherent in developing the collaborative relationships addressed by 
this review. These parent authors described the challenges to forming relationships in terms of 
parent-professional conflict and resolution, contextualised against the backdrop of individual, 
institutional, and societal power relationships. Power relationships in this context refer to 

decision-making authority, control of resources, and influence over people and supports; which 
have traditionally been part of the professional role.

Turnbull's 1980s collection of essays, authored by parent-professionals and entitled "Parents 
speak out: Then and now", is a seminal work having influenced a subsequent body of research 
examining family quality of life including parental roles, and advocacy. The parent-professional 
discourses of disability reflected societal views and the attitudes reflected by the terminologies 
do not always sit comfortably with a modern audience, attuned to disability rights and 
empowerment. Even so, there are useful insights to be gained from these discourses; including 
Shultz's "the Parent-Professional Conflict'. Shultz, both a teacher and parent, describes herself 
as the "object of my own dissatisfaction" which captures the often-impossible positioning of the 
parent-professional in this inoperable relationship.

Parents have been described as either assuming or being compelled into multiple roles towards 
their disabled child and when responding to disability services, being: (a) the source of their 
child's problems, (b) recipients of professionals'decisions, (c) family members, (d) consumers, 
(e) learners and teachers, (f) organisation members, (g) political advocates, (h) educational 
decision-makers, and (i) service developers. Political advocacy, service development, and 
membership of parent organisations can be forms of parent activism, a term which reflects the 
motivation of parents to bring about change in the policies and systems which control access to 
community participation for their children. The parent movement, arising in the early 1970 s and 
continuing to the 2000's, specifically in the United States and other Western nations, acting 
through a network of organisations, has promoted the rights of people with disabilities, ascribed 
value to disabled people, and promoted inclusion in community life. These activities preceded 
the rise in disability rights groups organised and run by disabled activists and can be seen as 
resistance to the 'professional appropriation of parenthood' a social phenomenon occurring 
throughout the 20th Century.

The prevailing medical model at the time equated disability with impairments of the physical 
body. The functionalist paradigm in which the medical model of disability is situated views 
disability as inherently pathological with a focus on assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. By 
contrast, the structural paradigm, in which the social model of disability is often situated, focuses
on the oppositional structures producing inequalities and social injustice, and leading to 
disablement. Gabel asserted that there is a growing conceptual acknowledgement of resistance 
theory across these medical/social paradigms. As disability advocates, many parents have 
navigated this tension. Resistance and self-advocacy allow for more complex interpretations of 
disability/impairment than either the medical or social models provide and are proposed in 
recent literature to offer a way forward for both disabled people and their families.

Systems of Influence on Parent-Professional Collaboration

This narrative describes the influence of 'systems-thinking' on parent-professional collaboration 
within healthcare and disability services. Starting from the 1970 s, and in response to the 
development of General Systems Theory there was an evolution in scientific thinking from 
traditional linear paradigms of cause and effect, towards the conceptualisation of circular, 
interdependent models of complex systems. When applied to health and disability services, 
systems theory challenges the validity of 'treating' the disabled child in isolation, instead 
acknowledging the role of the family and wider environmental influences. In psychology, this 
was illustrated by a move from the psychoanalytic view of the individual as patient, suffering 
from a pathology, towards the humanistic view of families as interdependent.

A seminal work within this research tradition is Seligman and Darling's book, Ordinary Families 
Special Children. Their influential ideas, drawing on the philosophy of systems theories, 
presented the family as a complex and interactive system, in which each member interacts with 
every other in an interdependent way. A subsequent research tradition developed with a focus 
on understanding and intervening in family systems.

In contrast, the social ecological model located the family in the wider social, economic, and 
political systems which influence its functioning. Within the social-ecological paradigm, the 
parent-professional encounter is viewed from a sociological perspective as an interaction 
situation. When the child and family are the sole focus of intervention social-system influences 
can be overlooked. Thus, complex interventions which strengthen all levels of family functioning 
are required to strengthen resilience and improve collaboration.

Empowered through Partnership: The Parent Paradox

Research categorised within this tradition addresses and restructures hierarchies within the 
parent-professional relationship. The partnership paradigm developed from the underlying 
philosophy of proactive empowerment through partnerships, drawing upon Rappaport's work in 
community psychology. In Rappaport's work, empowerment is conceptualised as both the 
process and outcome that enables marginalised people to gain control and autonomy over their 
lives. Application of this work to the parent-professional relationship sees an empowered parent 
being able to fully participate in partnership with professionals involved in their child's care. The 
focus is on the agency of the parent, and the professional role in promoting this agency.

Research exploring the experiences of parents identifies a situational paradox, which some 
scholars argue arises from parenting a disabled child in a largely ableist society. This work 
draws on Foucadian and Bourdesian theories to explore how parents navigate power and 
knowledge relations in the context of their child's perceived 'deviance or normality'. The 
discourses of parents, mainly documented by and with mothers, indicate that they navigate 
between a position of adaptation and resistance or appeasement in the face of professionals' 
descriptions of their child's dis/ability. In this way, parents navigate the paradoxical situation of 
both complying with' and 'adapting to' disability services, whilst also 'negotiating' and 'resisting', 
as they develop positive models of disability whilst striving to maintain their partnerships with 
professionals.

However, the existence of 'artificial' bureaucracies in institutions gives rise to what Foucault 
described as 'buried and disqualified' knowledge, an undervaluing of the knowledge which 
parents bring. As this body of literature developed, increasing ambiguity of related terms such 
as empowerment, engagement, enablement, participation, and involvement was described.

Relationship-Focused Interventions

This research tradition arises from a conceptual paper by Baird and Peterson discussing 
tensions between family-centred philosophy and interventions aimed at modifying aspects of 
parent-child interaction. Proponents of family-centred philosophy regard the family as the expert
and ultimate decision maker for their child, whilst respecting differences in parents' beliefs, 
values, and coping styles. Parent-child interaction therapy involves an evaluation and 
assessment process aimed at helping parents to modify their behaviours when interacting with 
their children.

Parent-child interaction therapies may require professionals to make subjective judgements 
about the interaction behaviour of parents and children which can be at odds with respect for 
the families' values, beliefs, and practices. This may negatively impact the collaborative 
relationship. Parent-child interaction therapies can be viewed as problematic and running 
counter to the tenents of family-centred philosophy. There are valid concerns about 
professionals making value-based judgements about parents in relation to their parenting. A 
second concern, in the light of evolving understandings about neurodiversity, is the selection of 
desired child outcomes which follow a normative, neurotypical bias (e.g., focusing on social 
engagement, sitting still). Making any assessment of parent-child interaction necessitates a 
judgement of that interaction against a set of values derived by professionals.

Cross-cultural work challenges the validity of assumptions about child development such as 
'normality' and 'risk', described as 'cultural constructs'. This research suggests that assumptions
arise from unconscious ethnocentrism, which may be reinforced by the assessment tools used 
to evaluate parent-child interaction and in the goals promoted by professionals.

Emerging within this research tradition examining relationship-based interventions is research 
discussing the application of coaching strategies. In a coaching model, coaches work together 
with parents to go beyond the identification of common goals to identify goals primarily 
articulated by the parent. Coaching is a collaborative reciprocal process involving cycles of 
action or practice, self- reflection, and self-correction. For healthcare professionals to move 
away from professional-led practice towards the use of coaching requires changes in 
professional behaviour and a need for role negotiation with parents as a pre-cursor to coaching.

Family-Centred or Service-Centred

The focus of this research tradition is collaborative models of service delivery as summed up by 
the philosophy of 'Family Centred Care". Family-centred philosophy has its early roots in 
nursing practice with hospitalised children. Drawing on earlier theories, seminal work by 
Rosenbaum and colleagues along with Dunst and collaborators and King and collaborators 
developed the theory and practice around family-centred care in early intervention and 
paediatric rehabilitation. Family centred philosophy positions the family unit as the recipient of 
services and parents as expert and ultimate decision maker for their child. Family-centred care 
recognises the family as constant in the child's life with autonomy to decide their level of 
participation, priorities, and goals. Such services should be delivered in a collaborative, trusting 
relationship with respect for families'cultural identities, beliefs, values, and styles of coping.

Four paradigm shifts, as recommended by Dunst et al., are needed for services to become 
family-centred, being shifts away from (a) intervention practices based solely on professional 
identified needs towards responsive practice, (b) intervention practices focusing primarily on 
correcting child and family deficits towards strength-based practice, (c) defining solutions to 
child and family needs solely in terms of professional services, and (d) paternalistic, 
dependency forming help giving practices towards empowering practices. Following 40 years of 
family-centred practice, questions remain as to whether family-centred services are deliverable 
or remain an unattainable ideal. Research has indicated highly significant differences between 
parents' actual roles in therapy and the ideal roles involving participation in decisions, 
assessment of their family's needs, and family centred services representing a gap between 
'work as imagined' and 'work as done in relation to service delivery for children and families.

Social Policy: The Professional Dilemma

This narrative explores the influence of social policy and legislation on parent-professional 
relationships. Social policy dictates the roles that parents and professionals are expected to fulfil
in the provision of services to children with special educational and health needs.

Goodley and Runswick-Cole's work on 'developmentalism', conceptualised the 'child', 'disabled',
and 'parents' in social policy in England and influenced scholarship within the growing field of 
Critical Disability Studies. Developmentalism arose from developmental psychology, drawing on
the work of Piaget and Vygotsky, and has led to terminology and practice in both education and 
healthcare which is focused on 'normal' versus 'abnormal' child development. Mothers are 
positioned as the means by which children's development is accelerated towards 'normal' 
developmental milestones. New Labour government policy between 1997-2007 outlined both 
parents' rights and responsibilities leading to a mixture of support and surveillance for parents of
disabled children, by these parents having the most frequent and sustained contact with 
professionals.

Hellawell describes the paradoxical situation in which parents are led to believe they will have 
choice in the decision-making processes regarding their child's placements and service 
provision, whilst authorities have the right to overturn these decisions. Professionals are 
gatekeepers to the allocation of resources, and are therefore given finite resource and service 
availability; parents' wishes are often disregarded. Conversely, when things go wrong in 
children's lives, the implication from policy is that parents are wholly accountable. This is a 
situation which threatens parent-professional partnerships and poses a dilemma for 
professionals who are empathetic to parents' challenges and wish to avoid conflicts arising from
parental expectations. Many parents will advocate for their own child's needs, expressing their 
individual preferences; whilst professionals often have a sense of distributive justice based on 
the needs of the population they serve in the light of available resources. This can lead to 
professionals experiencing a moral anxiety due to conflicting responsibilities and roles between 
'benefits for all' versus 'best outcomes for the individual'.

Discussion

The need for parents and professionals to work collaboratively in the interests of the child with 
disability can be traced back to roots in the disability rights movements of the 1970 s and the 
social model of disability (credited to Oliver, 1983) which states that physical, societal, and 
attitudinal barriers disable people with impairments. In the five decades since, research 
traditions have evolved, raising awareness of the imperative for collaboration. However, 
divergent or potentially conflicting research traditions and policy frameworks have fragmented 
the concept of collaboration into multiple terms and approaches, all of which lack clear 
definition.

There is some agreement across research traditions that contributors to collaborative 
partnerships include honest communication, mutual commitment, parent empowerment, 
professional competency, equality, trust, and respect. Also, collaborative processes are often 
described as including mutually agreed goals, shared planning, shared implementation, shared 
responsibility, and shared evaluation. However, the tensions and potential conflicts between 
divergent traditions and approaches, outlined in this review, show how parents and 
professionals can be inhibited in behaving in these ways by societal and institutional contexts, 
even when they are motivated to do so.

The review has explored how aspects of both the internal and external environments, within 
which these relationships are centred, can lead to conflict and inhibit the development of 

productive collaborative partnerships. Important differences exist between individualism of 
choice and equality of provision and these need to be resolved. In particular, there should be 
clarification of roles and expectations, in recognition that parent and professional role ambiguity 
is driven by cultural understandings of power in parent-professional relationships. Dialogue and 
discussion about conceptualisations of children's disability should explore why consideration of 
both strengths and impairments can lead to conflict between parents and professionals.

In conclusion, collaboration between parents and professionals is vital for both the process and 
outcomes of interventions for children with neurodisabilities. Such interventions need to be 
considered in the context of the complex systems within which parents, children, and 
professionals interact and, as such, need to be flexible and responsive. Models of service 
delivery for disabled children have attempted to move away from former paternalistic attitudes. 
However, these persist due to the nature of professional training, policy and organisational 
barriers and resource pressures.
