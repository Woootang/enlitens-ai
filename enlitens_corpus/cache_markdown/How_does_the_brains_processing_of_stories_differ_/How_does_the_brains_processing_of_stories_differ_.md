The Brain’s Processing of Stories Versus Facts: Key Differences and
Mechanisms

1. Introduction

The human brain processes stories and facts through distinct, though overlapping, neural mechanisms. Stories

(narratives) engage brain networks involved in simulation, social cognition, and long-timescale integration, such as

the default mode network (DMN), medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex. This supports the

construction of coherent situation models, emotional engagement, and memory integration (Altmann et al., 2014;

Maguire et al., 1999; Tylén et al., 2015; Aboud et al., 2019; Baldassano et al., 2018; Baldassano et al., 2016; Yarkoni et

al., 2008; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2019; Simony et al., 2016; Song et al., 2020; Tamir et al., 2016; Grall et

al., 2021; Mar, 2011). In contrast, facts and expository information tend to activate regions associated with action-

based reconstruction, semantic memory, and goal-directed, top-down processing, often involving the

frontoparietal control network (Altmann et al., 2014; Aboud et al., 2019; Abraham et al., 2008; Jääskeläinen et al.,

2020). Stories are generally better remembered and more engaging than facts, likely due to their alignment with

the brain’s natural information processing architecture (Morris et al., 2019; Mar et al., 2021; Yarkoni et al., 2008;

Grall et al., 2021). This review synthesizes neuroimaging, behavioral, and cognitive research to clarify how the

brain’s processing of stories differs from its processing of facts.

2. Methods

A Deep Search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic Scholar

and PubMed. The search included 20 targeted queries spanning foundational theory, neural mechanisms,

developmental changes, and interdisciplinary perspectives. Out of 1,034 identified papers, 635 were screened, 409
met eligibility criteria, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1 Neural Networks for Stories vs. Facts

•

Stories activate the default mode network (DMN), including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate

cortex, and angular gyrus, supporting integration of information over long timescales, social cognition, and

mental simulation (Maguire et al., 1999; Tylén et al., 2015; Aboud et al., 2019; Baldassano et al., 2018; Baldassano

et al., 2016; Yarkoni et al., 2008; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2019; Simony et al., 2016; Song et al., 2020;

Tamir et al., 2016; Grall et al., 2021; Mar, 2011).

•

•

Facts and expository texts engage the frontoparietal control network, which is associated with goal-directed,

top-down processing and working memory (Altmann et al., 2014; Aboud et al., 2019; Abraham et al., 2008;

Jääskeläinen et al., 2020).

When reading factual information, the brain shows patterns suggesting action-based, past-oriented

reconstruction, while fiction and stories elicit constructive simulation and imagination of possible events

(Altmann et al., 2014; Tylén et al., 2015; Aboud et al., 2019; Abraham et al., 2008; Jacobs & Willems, 2018).

3.2 Memory and Comprehension

•

•

•

Stories are more easily understood and better recalled than expository texts or isolated facts, as shown in a
meta-analysis of over 33,000 participants (Mar et al., 2021).

Memory for stories relies on hierarchical plot structures and situation models, with high-level narrative elements

being more central to recall than isolated facts (Thorndyke, 1977; Baldassano et al., 2016; Yarkoni et al., 2008;
Masís-Obando et al., 2021; Lee & Chen, 2022).

The DMN and medial temporal lobe structures interact to encode and retrieve narrative events, supporting the
integration of new information with prior knowledge (Maguire et al., 1999; Baldassano et al., 2018; Baldassano et

al., 2016; Yarkoni et al., 2008; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Masís-Obando et al.,

2021; Lee & Chen, 2022; Kauttonen et al., 2018).

3.3 Event Segmentation and Integration

•

•

The brain segments stories into discrete events, with high-order cortical regions (e.g., angular gyrus, posterior
medial cortex) representing abstract situation models and event boundaries (Baldassano et al., 2016; Nguyen et

al., 2019; Michelmann et al., 2020; Masís-Obando et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2021; Simony et al., 2016; Lee &

Chen, 2022).

Coherent plot formation in stories relies on the DMN, while incoherent or fact-based episodes activate the

frontoparietal control network (Tylén et al., 2015; Aboud et al., 2019; Baldassano et al., 2016; Yarkoni et al., 2008;

Yeshurun et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2019; Simony et al., 2016; Song et al., 2020; Tamir et al., 2016; Grall et al.,
2021; Mar, 2011).

3.4 Social Cognition and Simulation

•

•

Story comprehension recruits mentalizing networks (theory of mind), supporting understanding of characters’

intentions and emotions (Aboud et al., 2019; Yarkoni et al., 2008; Nijhof & Willems, 2015; Tamir et al., 2016; Mar,

2011).

Reading fiction or stories enhances social-cognitive abilities and empathy, mediated by DMN activation (Tamir

et al., 2016; Mar, 2011).

4. Discussion

The evidence demonstrates that the brain processes stories and facts through both shared and distinct neural

pathways. Stories preferentially engage the DMN and mentalizing networks, supporting integration, simulation, and

social cognition, while facts and expository texts rely more on the frontoparietal control network for goal-directed,

analytical processing (Altmann et al., 2014; Maguire et al., 1999; Tylén et al., 2015; Aboud et al., 2019; Baldassano et
al., 2018; Abraham et al., 2008; Baldassano et al., 2016; Yarkoni et al., 2008; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Nguyen et al.,

2019; Jääskeläinen et al., 2020; Simony et al., 2016; Song et al., 2020; Tamir et al., 2016; Grall et al., 2021; Mar, 2011).

This distinction helps explain why stories are more engaging, memorable, and effective for knowledge transmission

and social learning (Morris et al., 2019; Mar et al., 2021; Yarkoni et al., 2008; Grall et al., 2021). The DMN’s role in

integrating information over long timescales and constructing situation models is central to narrative

comprehension, while the frontoparietal network supports the processing of discrete facts and logical arguments

(Aboud et al., 2019; Abraham et al., 2008; Jääskeläinen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).

However, there is considerable overlap, and both types of information can activate shared language and memory

systems. Individual differences, developmental stage, and the coherence of the material further modulate these

effects (Aboud et al., 2019; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Cohen et al., 2022). Some studies suggest that the distinction
between narrative and expository processing is not absolute, and that both genres can recruit similar networks

depending on task demands and content (Aboud et al., 2019; Blank & Fedorenko, 2017; Xu et al., 2020).

5. Conclusion

The brain processes stories and facts using both shared and distinct neural systems. Stories engage the DMN and

mentalizing networks for integration, simulation, and social cognition, while facts rely more on frontoparietal and
semantic memory networks for analytical processing. This distinction underlies the superior memorability and

engagement of stories.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for distinct processing pathways, more research is needed on how individual differences,

developmental changes, and content features modulate these effects, and how narrative and expository processing

interact in real-world learning.

Future research should explore how narrative and factual processing interact, how individual and developmental
differences shape these processes, and how to leverage these insights for education and communication.

Question

Why

How do individual differences (e.g., age, expertise, empathy)
modulate neural processing of stories versus facts?

Personalization could improve learning and
communication strategies.

How do narrative and expository processing interact during
real-world learning and decision-making?

Understanding this could optimize educational
and persuasive communication.

What are the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of
narrative and factual information in memory?

This could inform interventions for memory and
comprehension deficits.

FIGURE  Open research questions for future investigation on neural processing of stories and facts.

In summary, stories and facts are processed differently in the brain, with stories leveraging networks for integration,

simulation, and social cognition, and facts engaging analytical and semantic systems—explaining why stories are
often more memorable and engaging.
