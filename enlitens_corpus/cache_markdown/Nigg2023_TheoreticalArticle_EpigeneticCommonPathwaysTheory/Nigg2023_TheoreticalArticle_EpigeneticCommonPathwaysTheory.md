DOCUMENT SUMMARY This theoretical paper argues for a modern, dynamic understanding of
mental disorders, rejecting outdated static models. It proposes an epigenetic and "common 
pathways" theory, suggesting that despite a vast number of genetic and environmental risks, 
psychopathology emerges from the perturbation of a finite, shared set of biological and 
psychological regulatory mechanisms. This "funnel" model, which places epigenetics and self-
regulation at its core, provides a powerful framework for understanding how life experience 
becomes biologically embedded and makes the complex problem of mental illness scientifically 
tractable.

Considerations Toward an Epigenetic and 
Common Pathways Theory of Mental 
Disorder

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper provides the overarching scientific and philosophical framework for the entire 
Enlitens mission. It masterfully articulates the paradigm shift away from the static, categorical 
"disease" models we reject, and toward the dynamic, developmental, epigenetic, and context-
dependent model we champion. The central "Common Pathways Hypothesis" gives us a 
powerful, scientifically-grounded way to explain why a dimensional and holistic approach is 
necessary and how the immense complexity of mental health can be made understandable. 
This is a foundational text that provides the language and conceptual architecture for our work, 
from our whitepaper to our clinical assessments.

Critical Concepts for Our Work

This paper introduces and defines several key concepts that are central to the Enlitens model.

● Dynamic Systems View: Mental disorders are not fixed entities but emerge from a 
"failure of recursive, homeostatic processes to achieve adaptive re-equilibrium" after 
being disturbed. It is the result of a dynamic system being unable to regain balance.
● The Exposome: This term refers to the totality of environmental exposures—from 
"synthetic chemicals, dietary constituents, psychosocial stressors, and physical 
factors"—that influence human development. To understand the brain, we must have a 
proper account of the exposome.

● Biological Embedding via Epigenetics: Epigenetics is presented as a primary 

mechanism for how the exposome gets "under the skin". It is the process by which 
environmental exposures can cause heritable changes to the genome that regulate gene
expression without changing the DNA sequence itself.

● Common Pathways Hypothesis (The Funnel): This is the core proposal of the paper. 

It posits that while the number of inputs (genes, environmental risks) and outputs 
(symptoms, disorders) is vast, they converge on a
 finite and tractable set of shared regulatory pathways. This "funnel" (see Figure 2 in
source) makes the problem of explaining psychopathology scientifically manageable.
● Self-Regulation: Defined as the adjustment of affect, thought, or action to maintain 

adaptation, this is proposed as a key psychological common pathway. It includes both 
bottom-up (automatic) and top-down (deliberate) processes.

● Perturbation: To avoid confusion with purely psychological stress, the author uses 
"perturbation" to refer to the full range of chemical and social challenges from the 
exposome that are strong enough to require a psychobiological adaptive response.

Theoretical Framework We Can Use

The paper provides a powerful conceptual framework that directly supports our clinical and 
scientific approach.

● The Funnel Model (Figure 2): This visual metaphor is central to the theory.

1.

Inputs: A wide range of genotypes, exposures, environments, and their 
interactions.

2. The Funnel: A finite set of shared regulatory processes or pathways across 

multiple units of analysis (e.g., epigenetic, physiological, neural, psychological).

3. Outputs: Multiple, diverse developmental and psychopathology pathways.
● Multi-Unit Analysis (Figures 1 & 3): The theory demands an integrated understanding 

across different "units of analysis" rather than focusing on just one. The four key 
domains are:

1. Systems Biology (genetics, physiology).
2. The Exposome (social, chemical, nutritional environments).
3. Development (timing, learning history, trajectory).
4. Mental/Psychological Processes (appraisal, evaluation, self-regulation).
● Rejection of Reductionsim: The paper argues against "eliminative reductionism" (the 
idea that smaller units like genes will eventually explain and replace larger units like 
behavior). It states that in complex systems like the brain, lower units constrain but do
 not fully explain higher units of analysis. The psychological level is essential for a full 
explanation.

Findings That Challenge the System

The entire paper is a critique of the status quo in psychopathology research and diagnosis.

● Rejection of Static "Disease" Models: The paper opens by stating, "Static models of 
psychopathology are as a set of fixed entities are outdated. Instead, psychopathology 
must be understood dynamically".

● No Simple Biomarkers: It argues that for the vast majority of mental health conditions, 

"the long search for definitive single biomarkers of individual disorders appears ill 
conceived". It emphasizes there is "No isomorphism... between the main population of 
psychopathology phenotypes and biology" .

● Context is Everything: The theory calls for "contextually-informed rather than context-

free biomarker, mechanism, and genetic studies".

● Complexity and Heterogeneity are the Rule: The paper asserts that mental disorders 
are not discrete diseases but are complex, partially related, and highly heterogeneous 
phenomena.

Populations Discussed

The theory is presented as a general model for psychopathology, with a strong emphasis on its 
developmental origins. It notes that the onset of mental disorders disproportionately affects 
children, adolescents, and young adults, making a developmental perspective essential. The 
model is designed to apply across the full spectrum of conditions, from neurodevelopmental 
disorders like ADHD to mood disorders and psychosis .

Quotes We Might Use

● "Psychopathology emerges from the dynamic interplay of physiological and mental 

processes and ecological context. It can be seen as a failure of recursive, homeostatic 
processes to achieve adaptive re-equilibrium" .

● "An epigenetic perspective elevates the importance of developmental context and 

adaptive systems, particularly in early life, while opening the door to new mechanistic 
discovery".

● "The key proposal is that a finite number of homeostatic biological and psychological 
mechanisms are shared across most risky environments (and possibly many genetic 
liabilities) for psychopathology".

● "I hypothesize that the universe of mechanistic human self-regulatory processes is 
smaller than the universe of inputs or the complex combinations of behavioral and 
mental outputs".

● "Mental disorder thus emerges from a perturbation of a dynamic system that is unable to

regain an adaptive equilibrium (or homeostasis) and instead canalizes into a 
maladaptive or unstable developmental course...".

● "Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the face of environmental pressure is an 
essential mechanism to include, and not merely a metaphor for development...".

Clinical Implications

● Shift in Clinical Formulation: The theory advocates for a conceptual shift in clinical 
practice "away from static conditions with linear inputs, and toward an emergent 
formulation".

● Goal of Intervention: From this perspective, the goal of intervention is "to reestablish 

homeostasis, perhaps at a new set point, for a faltering dynamic system".

● Multi-Level Interventions: This can be achieved through multiple avenues, including 
"introducing new information (biologically or cognitively), adding supports (e.g., social), 
or providing opportunity for reorganization (e.g., new environmental niches)".

● Identifying Critical Periods: A key clinical goal is the "identification of phase-state 
transition periods, particularly in early life," which could become prime targets for 
prevention.
