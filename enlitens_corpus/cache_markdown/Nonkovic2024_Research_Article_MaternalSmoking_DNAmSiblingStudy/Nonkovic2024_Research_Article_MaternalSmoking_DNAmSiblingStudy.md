DOCUMENT SUMMARY Using a powerful sibling-comparison design to control for genetic and 
family-level confounds, this study provides strong, quasi-causal evidence that maternal smoking
during pregnancy causes long-lasting changes in offspring's DNA methylation, detectable years 
later in adolescence. Higher prenatal smoke exposure was specifically linked to altered 
methylation in genes related to neurodevelopment (CNTNAP2) and cellular function (MYO1G, 
CYP1A1). The findings robustly support DNA methylation as a key mechanism through which 
the prenatal environment becomes biologically embedded and has lasting effects on 
development.

Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy Is 
Associated With DNA Methylation in Early 
Adolescence: A Sibling Comparison 
Design

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is exceptionally important because its robust sibling-comparison design provides 
some of the strongest, most direct evidence for our core principle of biological embedding. By 
comparing siblings who had different prenatal smoke exposures within the same family, the 
study moves beyond simple correlation to establish a quasi-causal link between a specific early-
life environmental factor and long-term changes in a child's epigenome.

This rigorously controlled study confirms that DNA methylation is a key biological mechanism 
through which the prenatal environment exerts lasting effects on development. It provides a 
concrete, scientific example of how "the life it's lived"—starting from the moment of conception
—shapes biology in a way that is detectable more than a decade later. This evidence is 
foundational for our model, which posits that understanding a person's unique developmental 
history is essential to understanding their present-day functioning.

Critical Statistics for Our Work

Study Population & Design

● Sample: 328 sibling pairs where the mother's smoking status differed between the two 
pregnancies. The average ages of the siblings at the time of the study were 13.02 and 
10.20 years.

● Design: A sibling-comparison model was used to separate child-specific "within-family" 
effects of smoking from "between-family" effects that represent shared genetic and 
environmental confounds.

Key Findings on MSDP and DNA Methylation

● "Within-Family" Effects (Evidence for Causation): The sibling with a higher severity 
of prenatal smoke exposure showed significant differences in DNA methylation years 
later. Specifically, higher child-specific Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy (MSDP) 
was associated with:

○ More global DNAm (methylation across the entire genome).
○ Less methylation of the neurodevelopmental gene

 CNTNAP2.

○ More methylation of the

 MYO1G gene.

○ More methylation of the

 CYP1A1 gene.

● Robustness: These child-specific associations remained significant even after 

controlling for other prenatal and postnatal exposures like secondhand smoke and air 
pollution (PM2.5).

● "Between-Family" Effects (Evidence for Familial Confounding): For the genes 

MYO1G and CYP1A1, there was also a significant between-family effect, meaning that 
families with higher average smoking across both pregnancies had higher methylation in
their children. This suggests that for these specific genes, both the direct effect of 
smoking and other shared familial factors (e.g., genetics, environment) contribute to 
DNAm changes.

● Link to ADHD: The study found only weak, exploratory evidence that DNAm might 

explain the link between MSDP and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms. The association 
between MSDP and ADHD-HI on the Conners scale became statistically non-significant 
when methylation of
 CNTNAP2 or MYOIG was included in the model.

Methodology We Can Learn From

The sibling-comparison design is the key methodological strength of this study. This quasi-
experimental approach is a gold standard for developmental research when randomized trials 
are impossible.

● How it Works: The model analyzes siblings who grew up in the same family but had 

different specific exposures (in this case, prenatal smoke).

● Controlling for Confounds: By comparing two siblings, the design naturally controls for
all factors they share: ~50% of their genes, the same parents, socioeconomic status, 
home environment, etc.

● Separating Effects: The analysis statistically separates the "within-family" effect (the 
difference between siblings, attributable to the specific exposure) from the "between-
family" effect (the average of the siblings, attributable to shared familial factors). A 
significant "within-family" effect provides much stronger evidence for a causal 
relationship than findings from traditional studies of unrelated individuals.

Findings That Challenge the System

● Moves Beyond Correlation Toward Causation: This study's design directly addresses

the common critique of developmental research—that associations are merely 
correlational and driven by confounding family variables. By demonstrating a child-
specific biological effect of smoking that is distinct from shared family factors, it provides 
powerful evidence that the prenatal environment itself can have a causal impact.
● The Prenatal Environment Leaves a Lasting Biological Signature: The fact that a 

prenatal exposure that ended at birth leaves a detectable epigenetic mark in saliva over 
a decade later is a profound demonstration of the persistence of biological embedding. It
shows that the body "remembers" its earliest experiences at a cellular level.

● Dimensional View of Exposure: The study used a 7-point severity score for MSDP that
accounted for both the timing (which trimester) and quantity of smoking, rather than a 
simple yes/no variable. This dimensional approach allows for a more nuanced 
understanding of risk.

Populations Discussed

● Children and Adolescents: The study measured outcomes in offspring during middle 

childhood and early adolescence (average ages 10 and 13).

● Sibling Pairs Discordant for Prenatal Exposure: This is a unique and powerful 

sample specifically recruited to isolate the effects of a specific prenatal environment.
● Note on Generalizability: The authors explicitly state that the sample is 96% White, 
which limits the generalizability of the findings to more racially and ethnically diverse 
populations.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the study's significance: "We found differential deoxyribonucleic acid methylation 
(DNAm) during middle childhood and adolescence for children exposed to maternal 
smoking during pregnancy compared to their unexposed sibling in a rigorously controlled
study...".

● On the main takeaway: "These findings support DNAm as a key biological mechanism 

by which prenatal exposures exert long-term effects on children's development".
● On establishing a causal link: "[Our findings] corroborate emerging evidence for a 

potentially causal pathway between MSDP and DNAm".

● On the specific results: "We found that child-specific MSDP was associated with global 
DNAm, and CNTNAP2, CYPIAI, and MYOIG methylation after covariate adjustment...".
● On the strength of the design: "The current study aims to... replicate the associations of 
MSDP and DNAm... using a sibling-comparison design... adjusting for prenatal and 
postnatal covariates in order to isolate the MSDP exposure on DNAm".

Clinical Implications

● The study provides strong biological evidence to support public health initiatives aimed 
at eliminating smoking during pregnancy, demonstrating that the effects are cellular, 
long-lasting, and not simply attributable to other family risk factors.

● The very weak and inconsistent link between the measured DNAm and ADHD 

symptoms suggests that the pathway from prenatal exposure to complex behavioral 
outcomes is not simple or direct. This supports a model where multiple genetic, 
epigenetic, and environmental factors interact over time to shape neurodevelopment, 
rather than a single biological marker acting as a determinative cause.
