DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a foundational scientific minireview from the journal Cell, titled "Cellular 
Signaling: Pivoting around PDK-1." It focuses on the critical role of the enzyme 
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) within the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling pathway. The paper explains that PDK-1 is a master kinase that activates numerous 
other kinases in the AGC superfamily (like Akt/PKB and PKC), and its function is primarily 
regulated by substrate conformation and its location within the cell, rather than by being 
switched on or off itself.

Cellular Signaling: Pivoting around PDK-1

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway mediates a multitude of cellular 
responses following extracellular stimulation by peptide growth factors and hormones. 
Deregulation of this pathway is associated with human diseases such as cancer and diabetes. 
The importance of this pathway in cell biology is underscored by the fact that PI3K signaling 
influences both cell survival and death, in addition to other fundamental cellular functions such 
as growth, motility, differentiation and insulin action. It does so by activating multiple distinct 
secondary signaling cascades, and considerable information exists about the precise 
biochemical mechanisms by which PI3K mediates these events. One group of enzymes that 
has emerged as a key mediator of the PI3K signal is the AGC superfamily of serine/threonine 
protein kinases (so named because it includes protein kinases A, G, and C), long known to be 
critical components of the signal transduction machinery. Most members of this family require 
an activating phosphorylation, setting off the search for a potential upstream kinase that was 
linked to the PI3K pathway.

The search for such a kinase culminated with the discovery in 1997 of a novel 
member of the AGC family, the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1). 
PDK-1 has now been shown to stand at a pivotal point in signaling, initiating a flurry
of studies into understanding how PDK-1 function is regulated. This review 
discusses how the primary regulators of PDK-1 function are substrate conformation
and subcellular localization.

Akt/PKB, the Archetypal PDK-1 Substrate

The discovery that activation of the proto-oncogene Akt, also known as protein kinase B 
(PKB), is dependent on 3' phosphoinositides spawned much of the interest in the role of PI3K in
cell signaling. Both PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 bind with high affinity to the pleckstrin 
homology (PH) domain of Akt/PKB, thus recruiting the kinase to the plasma membrane. 
However, an additional event is required to fully activate Akt/PKB. A common regulatory 
mechanism of kinases is through phosphorylation of a segment near the entrance to the active
site, the activation loop, and a second phosphorylation site at the carboxyl terminus, in the 
hydrophobic motif. In Akt, these sites correspond to Thr308 in the activation loop and Ser473 
in the hydrophobic site. Extensive biochemical studies have clearly demonstrated that PDK-1 is 
the upstream kinase for Thr308. Following on the heels of the discovery that PDK-1 is the 
Akt/PKB upstream kinase came the observation that PDK-1 also phosphorylates a number of 
other kinases, including p70S6-kinase (p70S6-K) and protein kinase C (PKC).

Substrate Conformation: A Key Regulator of PDK-1 Activity

The phosphorylation of Akt/PKB by PDK-1 is regulated by the conformation of Akt. Specifically,
the engagement of the PH domain on the membrane by binding PtdIns-3,4,5-P₃/Ptdlns-3,4-P₂
relieves autoinhibition of the active site, allowing PDK-1 to access Thr308 on the activation 
loop. Similarly, access of PDK-1 to the activation loop of PKC is conformationally regulated. In 
this case, the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence of PKC must be removed from the 
substrate binding cavity in order for PDK-1 to phosphorylate PKC.

Thus, substrate conformation is a major determinant in allowing PDK-1 
phosphorylation to occur.

PDK-1 activates its substrate kinases by two mechanisms, direct or indirect. For Akt/PKB and 
the atypical PKC, phosphorylation at the activation loop serves as a direct "ON/OFF" switch for 
catalytic activity. In contrast, phosphorylation at the activation loop of conventional PKC 
isozymes does not result in activation but rather "primes" PKC for subsequent activation.

The Elusive PDK-2

While the regulation of the activation loop by PDK-1 is widely accepted, that of the C-terminal 
hydrophobic site (Ser473 in Akt/PKB) is less clear. This site is also conserved in other AGC 
kinases, and initial studies led to the proposal that an upstream kinase, distinct from PDK-1, 
was responsible. Thus, the name PDK-2 was coined for the hydrophobic site kinase. Despite 
extensive biochemical analyses, such an enzyme has remained refractory to identification. 
Autophosphorylation now appears to account for the mechanism by which the hydrophobic site 
is regulated in Akt/PKB.

PDK-1 and the Hydrophobic Motif

A series of studies provided the first evidence that PDK-1 interacts with high affinity with 
sequences corresponding to the C-terminal hydrophobic phosphorylation motif. This interaction 
appears to mask the autophosphorylation sites. Proteins containing PDK-1 Interacting 
Fragment (PIF) sequences could effectively compete for binding to PDK-1, releasing it from the
C terminus and unmasking the hydrophobic site for autophosphorylation.

Regulation of PDK-1: Lipids, Location, Phosphorylation, and "PIF"

In contrast to its substrates, no significant switches for the intrinsic kinase activity of PDK-1 
have yet to be defined. Rather, recent studies converge on the idea that PDK-1 function is 
regulated primarily by substrate conformation (as discussed above) and by cellular 
relocalization.

● Lipids & Location: The PH domain of PDK-1 selectively binds PtdIns-3,4-P2 and 

PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, explaining its relocalization from the cytosol to the plasma membrane 
in stimulated cells.

● Phosphorylation: The activation loop of PDK-1 itself is regulated by 

autophosphorylation. Additionally, tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Abl kinases 
can also activate PDK-1.

● "PIF": Binding of PIF to PDK-1 could stabilize the active conformation of PDK-1, 

increasing its activity toward substrates.

Perspectives

PDK-1 is a key enzyme in transducing signals to multiple effector pathways, and thus 
represents a pivotal point in PI3K-dependent and -independent signaling.

Initial findings that PDK-1 has a high basal activity even in unstimulated cells led to 
the notion that it is constitutively active, and that its activity is not critically regulated.
However, recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the function of PDK-1 is 
under tight control, with phosphorylation depending on substrate conformation and 
subcellular location.

The regulation by substrate conformation provides an attractive mechanism to allow PDK-1 to 
discriminate between one subset of targets over another, leading to a specific cellular response.
The challenge remains to attribute true PI3K-dependent signaling to specific PDK-1 targets.
