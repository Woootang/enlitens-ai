# Extracted Text for Overton_2023_RESEARCH_scoping_review_Self-Identification_Autism_Adults.md.pdf

DOCUMENT SUMMARY This 2023 scoping review is a foundational text that validates the 
process of adult self-identification of autism, concluding that self-identified adults often have a 
reasonably accurate understanding of their own autistic traits. The paper systematically 
documents the numerous barriers in the formal diagnostic system that necessitate self-
identification, including clinician skepticism, outdated stereotypes, and a history of misdiagnosis.
It serves as a powerful argument for a more client-centered, neurodiversity-affirming 
assessment process that values lived experience and self-knowledge.

Understanding the Self-identification of Autism in Adults: a Scoping 
Review

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This scoping review is a cornerstone document that scientifically validates our entire reason for 
existing. It systematically outlines the profound failures of the traditional diagnostic pathway for 
adults and provides powerful, evidence-based support for the accuracy and importance of self-
identification. The paper's findings on the barriers to diagnosis—particularly the skepticism and 
lack of knowledge among healthcare professionals—are the very problems Enlitens was 
created to solve. We can use this research to affirm our clients' journeys, educate other 
professionals on the legitimacy of self-discovery, and justify our interview-based, client-centered
model as the necessary solution to a deeply broken system. This paper provides the academic 
backing for our revolutionary stance.

Systemic Barriers That Force Self-Identification

The review identifies numerous barriers within the healthcare system that prevent adults from 
receiving a formal autism diagnosis, often leading them to self-identify as a necessary 
alternative.

● Clinician Skepticism and Lack of Knowledge:

○ General Practitioners (GPs) and other healthcare professionals often fail to 

recognize the presentation of autism in adults.

○ During initial appointments, many adults report not being taken seriously by 

professionals.

○ Clinicians often hold strong, stereotypical views of autism based on non-verbal 

children and have little awareness of how it presents across the lifespan.

○ This lack of understanding from professionals was a commonly reported barrier.

● Fear and Invalidation:

○ Many adults experience a fear of being disbelieved by their doctors, which acts 

as a significant barrier to even seeking a referral.

○ Difficulties in verbalizing their experiences and providing specific examples 

during the assessment process can prevent a referral or diagnosis.

● History of Misdiagnosis:

○ Adults frequently report a lifetime of being labeled with a broad range of mental 
health conditions (e.g., anxiety, personality disorders) that they felt did not fully 
explain their experiences.

● Practical and Financial Barriers:

○ Country-specific barriers are significant, including long waiting times in the UK 

and Canada and the expensive cost of assessments in the USA.

The Validity of Self-Identification

The review provides strong evidence that adults' self-identification is a legitimate and often 
accurate process.

● The authors conclude that adults who self-identify "seem to have a reasonably accurate 

recognition of autism/autistic traits in themselves".

● Multiple studies included in the review found that the results from self-identified autistic 

adults were "very similar" to the results from adults with a formal diagnosis.
● Despite this accuracy, this self-understanding is "often distrusted or ignored by 

healthcare professionals".

● The process of self-identification itself is deemed "an essential stage in the process 

towards the positive acknowledgment of an autistic identity".

The Journey of Self-Discovery

The review outlines the common process adults go through when self-identifying.

● The process often begins with a realization, sometimes starting in childhood or 

adolescence, of perceiving the world differently from peers and relatives.

● This consideration is often prompted by family members, friends, or media portrayals of 

autism.

● To validate this possibility, adults engage in extensive research, including online 

searches, reading books and articles, and watching documentaries.

● For many, self-identification is highly beneficial, providing an explanation and self-

understanding that had been missing their entire lives.

● Online autism forums and groups often provide a crucial "space of safety and personal 

reassurance".

A Call for a Neurodiversity-Affirming Approach

The review concludes by advocating for significant changes to the referral and diagnostic 
process, aligning directly with the Enlitens model.

● It highlights the need to develop "neurodivergent-friendly" clinical tools for use in 

assessment.

● It emphasizes the importance of a client-centered approach that gives adults the 
"opportunity to express in their own words the main strengths and difficulties they 
experience in real life".

● The authors suggest that tools like the Autism Spectrum Identity Scale (ASIS) could be 
used as facilitators in the diagnostic process to help clinicians understand clients' views 
from a client-centered, not just a medical, perspective.

● The review critiques the medical model's view of autism ("a mental health disorder that 
must be treated") and contrasts it with the neurodivergent approach ("a condition that is 
characterized by a broad range of strengths and weaknesses").

Quotes We Might Use

● On clinician failure: "...healthcare professionals seemed to have strong stereotypical 
views of the presentation of autism (more common in non-verbal children that are 
autistic), and little awareness and understanding of the different forms of autism through 
the lifespan".

● On the validity of self-identification: "In several of the studies that were reviewed in 
this scoping review... it was found that the results from adults who self-identified as 
autistic were very similar to the results of adults with a formal diagnosis of autism".
● On the importance of lived experience: "...it is important to give adults that self-

identify as autistic in clinical settings... the opportunity to express in their own words the 
main strengths and difficulties they experience in real life".

● On the benefit of self-discovery: "The majority of adults... considered self-identifying 
as autistic to be beneficial, from a personal perspective, because it had a positive 
influence on understanding who they really were".

● On the need for new tools: "...there are currently no neurodivergent-friendly 

(complementary) clinical tools in the referral and diagnostic process of an adult autism 
assessment, that have been developed and validated in the UK (or elsewhere) and 
consider the views of adults that self-identify as autistic".
