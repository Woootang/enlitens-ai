DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a foundational scientific review from the journal Cell, titled "Ras and 
Rho GTPases: A Family Reunion." It explores the coordinated actions and "cross-talk" 
between two critical families of molecular switches, the Ras and Rho GTPases. The 
paper details how these proteins work together to control essential cellular responses 
like gene expression, proliferation, oncogenic transformation, and actin-based cell 
motility. It outlines the molecular mechanisms for this cooperation, including signal 
divergence (one signal activating both pathways) and convergence (both pathways 
targeting the same downstream machinery), highlighting the complex interplay required 
for normal and pathological cell behavior.

Introduction

GTPases of the Ras superfamily act as molecular switches to control a wide range of 
essential biochemical pathways in all eukaryotic cells. Among the 60 or so that have 
been identified so far in mammalian cells, the Ras and the Rho families are of special 
interest since they couple intracellular signal transduction pathways to changes in the 
external environment. Like all GTPases, they exist in an inactive (GDP-bound) and an 
active (GTP-bound) conformation. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 
catalyze the release of GDP, allowing GTP to bind. In their active, GTP-bound state, 
Ras and Rho GTPases interact with target proteins to promote a cellular response. 
Finally, an intrinsic GTPase activity, catalyzed further by GTPase activating proteins 
(GAPs), completes the cycle and the GTPase returns to its inactive, GDP-bound state.

At least three striking features have emerged from the analysis of Ras and Rho 
GTPases: (1) the diversity of membrane receptors and upstream regulators that can 
activate these GTPases, (2) the diversity of cellular targets that can interact with an 
individual GTPase, and (3) the extensive cross-talk and cooperation that exists between
GTPase-regulated signal transduction pathways. Here, we will focus specifically on the 
growing number of examples... of the coordinated activation and the functional 
cooperation between members of the Ras and Rho GTPase families in animal cells.

Molecular Mechanisms of Cross-Talk

Although diverse in nature, the molecular events identified thus far as mediators of 
cross-talk between Ras and Rho GTPases can be broadly classified into two 
mechanistic frameworks: the branching of upstream signals, referred to here as signal 
divergence, and coordinated regulation of downstream functions, referred to here as 
signal convergence.

Signal Divergence

The activation of Ras and Rho GTPases in animal cells by extracellular stimuli is 
mediated by GEFs. The Cdc25 domain... defines a family of GEFs active on members 
of the Ras family, while the DH/PH motif... defines a family of GEFs... active on the 
Rho family. There are numerous examples of this type of signal divergence.

The addition of insulin to cultured fibroblasts leads to the rapid activation of Ras and 
Rac and inhibition of either GTPase does not interfere with activation of the other. In 
lymphocytes, stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) appears to activate Ras and Rac 
independently... Such parallel activation of small GTPases could most obviously occur 
through receptor recruitment of multiple exchange factors.

Ras and Rho GTPases can be activated in series, such that one small GTPase 
stimulates GTP loading on another. This appears to be a common mechanism of signal 
divergence... Cdc42 is a strong activator of Rac in many cell types, while Rac has been
reported to activate or inhibit Rho to varying degrees... However, cross-talk can also 
occur between the two families, and constitutively activated Ras, for example, is a 
potent activator of Rac.

Signal Convergence

The ser/thr kinase PAK has emerged as a molecule that can link Rac and Ras signaling
by converging on the ERK MAP kinase pathway. Receptor-mediated activation of Raf, 
the upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase in the ERK cascade, is Ras-dependent... Rac 
or Cdc42 can synergize with Raf to promote ERK activation and this synergy has been 
reported to occur at the level of the MAP kinase kinase, MEK1. It turns out that PAK, 
which is a Cdc42 and Rac target, can phosphorylate MEK1.

Another example of a molecule with the potential to connect Ras and Rho GTPase 
signaling pathways is p120RasGAP. This GTPase activating protein downregulates 
Ras, but... it has been shown that p120RasGAP forms a complex in cells with 
p190RhoGAP.

Biological Contexts for Cross-Talk

The existence of signaling mechanisms that link Ras and Rho GTPases argues for the 
physiological importance of cross-talk between these GTPases. This is reflected by the 
growing number of examples of biological responses that depend on the coordinated 
activation of members of both protein families.

Cell Proliferation

An important new concept to emerge from these studies is that the proliferative effects 
of Ras depend, at least under some circumstances, on signaling inputs from its relatives
Rac and Rho. In quiescent rat embryo fibroblasts, expression of constitutively activated 
forms of Rac and Raf is sufficient to stimulate G1/S transition indicating that Rac- and 
Raf-dependent signals act synergistically to regulate cell cycle progression. The Raf-
MEK-ERK cascade is responsible for the activation of CDK4 and CDK6... through 
mechanisms involving primarily the transcriptional induction of cyclin D1.

Oncogenic Transformation

Evidence that the transforming activity of Ras requires functional Rac and Rho proteins 
has been provided by studies showing that dominant negative mutants of Rac and Rho 
inhibit Ras-induced transformation, and constitutively activated mutants of Rac and Rho
cooperate with a constitutively activated Raf mutant in the induction of cellular 
transformation.

The Actin Cytoskeleton

The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in defining cell shape and morphology 
and in orchestrating many of the dynamic aspects of cell behavior such as cell 
migration, axon guidance, phagocytosis, and cytokinesis. There is now abundant 
evidence that Ras and Rho GTPases make distinct and cooperative contributions to 
these processes.

In mammalian cells, Rac is crucial for generating the actin-rich lamellipodial 
protrusions that are thought to be a major part of the driving force for 
movement... Cdc42 does not appear to be required for movement itself, but 
instead controls polarity signals that are required for directed migration... 
The contribution of Rho to cell migration is less clear.

Ras is known to make an essential contribution to cell migration... but its role may be 
cell type dependent. Clearly, many biochemical details remain to be clarified, but there 
is little doubt that the coordinated activities of at least four small GTPases (Cdc42, Rac,
Rho, and Ras) are required for cell migration in a variety of cell types.

Mechanisms of Signal Integration

Irrespective of the biological setting, a major mechanistic challenge posed by the 
combinatorial utilization of Ras and Rho GTPases is how the multiple signals that they 
transmit are processed coordinately to give rise to a specific physiological response.

Transcriptional Activation of the Serum Response Element

The serum response element (SRE) is a conserved promoter element that mediates 
the induction of many cellular immediate early genes following mitogenic stimulation. 
The activity of the SRE is dependent on the binding of the ubiquitous transcription factor
SRF. In the context of the c-fos SRE, SRF forms a ternary complex with members of 
the family of Ets domain protein, TCFs... The SRF-TCF ternary complex is subject to 
regulation by converging and parallel signals from Ras and Rho GTPases, thus forming
a molecular device for signal integration.

Integrin-Mediated Matrix Adhesion

Most mammalian cells are dependent on adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) 
for their growth, survival, and differentiation. It is well established that the effects of the 
ECM on cellular behavior are mediated by members of the integrin family of cell 
surface adhesion molecules. The binding of integrins to matrix proteins triggers a 
variety of intracellular signaling events, including the activation of Ras and Rho 
GTPases (outside-in signaling). Activated Ras and Rho GTPases in turn regulate the
extracellular binding activity of integrins (inside-out signaling).

Conclusions

The functional analysis of GTP binding proteins has most often led to the identification 
of a single, signal transduction pathway as being of particular importance... The 
identification of multiple target proteins for many of these GTPases (Rac has 12 so far) 
has, however, made this idea of simple linear pathways untenable and there is now little
doubt that members of the Ras and Rho GTPase families each control multiple 
intracellular pathways.

We have focused this review specifically on examples of cross-talk between 
Ras and Rho GTPases in animal cells. While the biochemical details by 
which this is achieved are still poorly understood, there is much experimental
work that points to the importance of combinatorial activities controlled by 
these two families in promoting complex biological responses such as cell 
proliferation, cell transformation, and cell migration.
