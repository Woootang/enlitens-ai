DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper provides critical neuroscientific evidence supporting a dual-process model of 
language, which reframes the use of "scripted" or formulaic language from a deficit into a 
distinct and valid communication system. The authors demonstrate that formulaic expressions 
(including idioms, social phrases, and swearing) are heavily reliant on the right hemisphere, in 
contrast to novel, grammatically-constructed sentences which rely on the left hemisphere. This 
finding is crucial for Enlitens, as it scientifically validates an assessment approach that 
recognizes and values all forms of communication, directly challenging standardized tests that 
narrowly focus on left-hemisphere dominant, propositional language.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "The preservation of swearing, serial speech, and speech formulas is well documented 

in clinical descriptions of aphasia."

● "These results support the notion that an intact RH [right hemisphere] supports use of 

some types of formulaic language."

● "Our results indicate a greater proportion of FEs [formulaic expressions] in the 

spontaneous speech of persons with LH [left hemisphere] damage, and proportionally 
fewer FEs in RH speech, when compared to normal control speakers."

● "Pragmatically determined vocal elements (pause fillers, discourse elements) were least 

present in RH dysfunction."

● "Our findings are also consistent with the dual-process model of language processing... 
which proposes two modes within language competence: storage and processing of 
fixed expressions, and generation of novel utterances."

● "'If it is possible for a speaker to access [linguistic material] in prefabricated form... then 
recognising when an aphasic person has done so will make an enormous difference' in 
how language ability is evaluated."

● "We can conclude, as Wray (2002) predicted, that 'some of the fluency achieved by 

people with Wernicke's aphasia is the result of using formulaic sequences'."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Dual-Process Model of Language

The paper's findings strongly support a dual-process model of language, which posits two 
distinct but complementary systems for communication:

1. Novel Language Generation: This mode involves the creation of new, original 

utterances based on grammatical rules (syntax) and word meanings (semantics). This 
system is traditionally associated with the
 left hemisphere (LH) language areas. Standardized language tests almost exclusively 
measure this type of processing.

2. Formulaic Language Processing: This mode involves the storage and retrieval of "pre-
fabricated," holistic linguistic chunks known as Formulaic Expressions (FEs). This study 
provides strong evidence that this system is supported by the
 right hemisphere (RH) and potentially subcortical structures.

Formulaic Expressions (FEs)

● Definition: FEs are familiar expressions that a native speaker would recognize as being 
learned and used as a whole chunk, rather than being generated from scratch each 
time. This includes a wide range of utterances that make up a large portion of normal 
speech (estimated between 15% and 40%).

● Categories of FEs: The study identified and analyzed nine categories of FEs based on 

previous neurolinguistic literature:

Idioms (e.g., "lost my train of thought")

1.
2. Conventional expressions (e.g., "as a matter of fact")
3. Conversational formulaic expressions (e.g., "first of all", "right")
4. Expletives (e.g., "damn")
5. Sentence stems (e.g., "I guess")
6. Discourse particles (e.g., "well")
7. Pause fillers (e.g., "uh")
8. Numerals (in the context of counting/serial speech)
9. Familiar proper nouns

● Function: FEs are a key aspect of pragmatic competence, crucial for fluid, naturalistic 

conversation.

KEY EVIDENCE & FINDINGS

The Central Finding: A Double Dissociation

The study's results showed a clear double dissociation, powerfully demonstrating the different 
roles of the left and right hemispheres in language production:

● Left-Hemisphere Damage (Aphasia): This group produced the highest proportion of 
formulaic speech (29.5%). Their novel language generation was impaired, but their 
ability to use pre-fabricated chunks was relatively preserved, leading to speech 
dominated by FEs.

● Right-Hemisphere Damage: This group produced the lowest proportion of formulaic 
speech (16.5%). Their ability to generate novel sentences was intact, but their access to
the stock of formulaic expressions was impaired.

● Normal Controls: The control group fell in the middle, using a mix of both systems, with 

FEs making up 24.6% of their speech.

Specific Findings for FE Subtypes

● Proper Nouns: The LH-damaged group produced strikingly fewer proper nouns than the
other two groups, supporting the association of proper noun anomia (difficulty naming) 
with LH damage.

● Pragmatic Elements: The RH-damaged group showed a significant lack ("paucity") of 
pause fillers and discourse elements (e.g., "well," "uh"). This is consistent with the RH's 
known role in managing pragmatic aspects of discourse and communication.

● Swearing/Expletives: Swearing is repeatedly identified as a category of formulaic 
language that is preserved in aphasia (LH damage), suggesting RH/subcortical 
mediation. Although no expletives were found in this specific dataset, the theoretical 
framework strongly supports its inclusion as an FE.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS FOR 
ENLITENS' ASSESSMENT MODEL

● Reframing "Scripting" as a Strength: This research provides the neuroscientific basis 
to reframe the use of formulaic language (often called "scripting" in autism) not as a 
deficit or a failed attempt at "normal" speech, but as the successful use of a distinct, RH-
mediated language system. An Enlitens clinician can identify and validate this as a 
legitimate and effective communication strategy.

● The Importance of Naturalistic Observation: The study analyzed spontaneous, 
natural speech. A clinical interview is the ideal setting to observe how an individual 
naturally blends formulaic and novel language. Standardized tests, with their forced-
choice and decontextualized prompts, cannot capture this dynamic and may penalize 
individuals who rely more on an RH-dominant, formulaic style.

● Improving Clinical Evaluation: The authors argue that failing to recognize the 

formulaic nature of a person's speech leads to an inaccurate evaluation of their language
ability.

○ For a person with fluent aphasia, what appears to be good recovery might 

actually be heavy reliance on FEs.

○ For individuals with RH damage, communication deficits can be "difficult to 

specify". This research shows that a key deficit is a reduced capacity to use FEs, 
which would manifest as pragmatically unusual or stilted speech. This has direct 
parallels to how neurodivergent communication is often mischaracterized.

● Developing Better Support: By identifying which language system is more robust in an 

individual, support can be better tailored. The authors note that "identification of 
relatively preserved formulaic expressions may provide a basis for a more effective 
treatment plan". For Enlitens, this means that if a client is a strong user of formulaic 
language, support should focus on leveraging this strength rather than trying to force 
them into a neurotypical, LH-dominant communication style.
