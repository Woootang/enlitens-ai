Co-Regulation, Attachment, and Therapeutic Alliance: What Does the Research
Say?

1. Introduction

Co-regulation—the dynamic, reciprocal process by which individuals influence and stabilize each other's

emotional and physiological states—plays a foundational role in both attachment relationships and the

development of a strong therapeutic alliance. Research consistently demonstrates that secure attachment and

effective co-regulation are linked to better relationship satisfaction, emotional stability, and positive clinical

outcomes. In psychotherapy, the therapeutic alliance is not only shaped by the client's and therapist's attachment

styles but is also actively maintained through ongoing co-regulatory processes, such as emotional attunement,

physiological synchrony, and collaborative goal-setting. These mechanisms are robust predictors of treatment

success across diverse modalities and populations (Soma et al., 2019; Mehmet, 2021; Baier et al., 2020; Marín-

Cavestany et al., 2025; Overall & Simpson, 2015; Rotger & Cabré, 2022; Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019; Wiebe & Johnson,

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search strategy included 20 targeted queries across 8 thematic groups,
focusing on co-regulation, attachment, therapeutic alliance, synchrony, and related constructs. In total, 959 papers

were identified, 675 were screened, 488 were deemed eligible, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in

this review.

3. Results

3.1. Co-Regulation in Attachment Relationships

Attachment theory posits that secure attachment is built on a foundation of effective co-regulation, where

caregivers provide consistent, attuned responses to a child's emotional and physiological needs. This process

fosters emotional stability, resilience, and the capacity for self-regulation in adulthood (Overall & Simpson, 2015;

Wiebe & Johnson, 2017; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Slade & Holmes, 2019; Kostøl & Kovač, 2023). Insecure

attachment, by contrast, is associated with less effective co-regulation and greater emotional instability (Overall &

Simpson, 2015; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Slade & Holmes, 2019; Diener & Monroe, 2011).

3.2. Co-Regulation and the Therapeutic Alliance

The therapeutic alliance—a collaborative, trusting relationship between therapist and client—is strongly influenced

by co-regulatory processes. Emotional and physiological synchrony, mutual attunement, and the therapist's ability

to provide a "secure base" are all linked to stronger alliances and better outcomes (Soma et al., 2019; Rotger &

Cabré, 2022; Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019; Kleinbub et al., 2020; Zilcha-Mano, 2017; Flückiger et al., 2020; Iovoli et al.,

2025; Flückiger et al., 2018; Wampold & Flückiger, 2023; Friedlander et al., 2018; Karver et al., 2018; Kaiser et al.,
2021; Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022; Hilpert et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2023; Degnan et al., 2016; Wiltshire et al.,

2020; Smith et al., 2010; Kostøl & Kovač, 2023; Bar-Sella et al., 2024; Zack et al., 2015). Both client and therapist
attachment styles contribute to the quality of the alliance, with secure attachment and strong self-regulation skills

predicting more robust alliances (Mehmet, 2021; Marín-Cavestany et al., 2025; Rotger & Cabré, 2022; Degnan et
al., 2016; Diener & Monroe, 2011; Ruiz-Aranda et al., 2021).

3.3. Mechanisms: Emotional and Physiological Synchrony

Recent studies highlight the role of emotional and physiological synchrony—such as heart rate variability,

electrodermal activity, and vocal arousal—in co-regulation during therapy. These synchrony processes are

associated with empathy, alliance strength, and session outcomes (Soma et al., 2019; Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019;
Kleinbub et al., 2020; Hilpert et al., 2020; Wiltshire et al., 2020; Coutinho et al., 2020). Dyadic regulation, including

both in-phase and antiphase synchrony, is observed in both romantic and therapeutic relationships (Soma et al.,

2019; Overall & Simpson, 2015; Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019; Wiltshire et al., 2020; Coutinho et al., 2020).

3.4. Co-Regulation as a Mechanism of Change

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews confirm that the therapeutic alliance mediates treatment outcomes, and
that co-regulation is a key mechanism underlying this effect (Baier et al., 2020; Rotger & Cabré, 2022; Zilcha-Mano,

2017; Flückiger et al., 2020; Lindqvist et al., 2023; Flückiger et al., 2018; Wampold & Flückiger, 2023; Friedlander et

al., 2018; Karver et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2021; Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022; Hilpert et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2023;

Slade & Holmes, 2019; Degnan et al., 2016; Wiltshire et al., 2020; Diener & Monroe, 2011; Smith et al., 2010; Kostøl
& Kovač, 2023; Bar-Sella et al., 2024; Zack et al., 2015). Improvements in alliance and co-regulation are reciprocally

linked to symptom reduction and emotional well-being (Flückiger et al., 2020; Lindqvist et al., 2023; Iovoli et al.,

2025; Flückiger et al., 2018; Karver et al., 2018; Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022; Hilpert et al., 2020; Bar-Sella et al.,
2024).

4. Discussion

The literature provides strong evidence that co-regulation is a core mechanism in both attachment relationships

and the therapeutic alliance. Secure attachment and effective co-regulation foster emotional stability, resilience,

and positive relational outcomes, while insecure attachment and poor co-regulation are linked to emotional

dysregulation and weaker alliances (Overall & Simpson, 2015; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Slade & Holmes, 2019;

Diener & Monroe, 2011; Smith et al., 2010). In psychotherapy, the alliance is both a product and a facilitator of co-

regulation, with emotional and physiological synchrony serving as measurable indicators of this process (Soma et
al., 2019; Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019; Kleinbub et al., 2020; Hilpert et al., 2020; Wiltshire et al., 2020; Coutinho et al.,

2020).

Meta-analyses confirm that the alliance robustly predicts treatment outcomes across modalities and populations
(Baier et al., 2020; Zilcha-Mano, 2017; Flückiger et al., 2020; Lindqvist et al., 2023; Flückiger et al., 2018; Wampold

& Flückiger, 2023; Friedlander et al., 2018; Karver et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2021; Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022;

Hilpert et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2023; Slade & Holmes, 2019; Degnan et al., 2016; Wiltshire et al., 2020; Diener &

Monroe, 2011; Smith et al., 2010; Kostøl & Kovač, 2023; Bar-Sella et al., 2024; Zack et al., 2015). The reciprocal

relationship between alliance and symptom improvement suggests that co-regulation is not only foundational but

also dynamic, evolving throughout the course of therapy (Flückiger et al., 2020; Lindqvist et al., 2023; Iovoli et al.,
2025; Flückiger et al., 2018; Karver et al., 2018; Zilcha-Mano & Fisher, 2022; Hilpert et al., 2020; Bar-Sella et al.,

2024). However, the field would benefit from more research on co-regulation in diverse contexts (e.g., online

therapy, group settings, non-Western populations) and on interventions that explicitly target co-regulatory

processes.

Co-regulation is a central mechanism linking attachment and the therapeutic alliance, with strong evidence

supporting its role in emotional stability, relationship quality, and treatment outcomes. The alliance is both a

product and facilitator of co-regulation, and synchrony processes are measurable indicators of this dynamic.
