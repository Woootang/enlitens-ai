DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This 2012 article from The British Journal of Psychiatry argues that the field is in crisis due to its 
over-reliance on a "technological paradigm," which views mental health problems as context-
independent, faulty mechanisms treatable with discrete interventions. This document is critical 
for Enlitens as it provides academic support for moving beyond rigid, biomedical models, 
validating the importance of relationships, meaning, context, and service-user collaboration—all 
central tenets of The Enlitens Interview.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Although it is impossible to answer such questions fully we believe that there is 

mounting evidence that good practice in psychiatry primarily involves engagement with 
the non-technical dimensions of our work such as relationships, meanings and values."

● "The dominance of this paradigm can be seen in the importance we have attached to 

classification systems, causal models of understanding mental distress and the framing 
of psychiatric care as a series of discrete interventions that can be analysed and 
measured independent of context.¹"

● "Furthermore, there is ample evidence that anti-stigma campaigns based on biogenetic 

models of serious mental illness have been counterproductive."

● "If we are genuine about promoting 'evidenced-based' practice, we will have to take this 

seriously. Second, real collaboration with the service user movement can only happen 
when psychiatry is ready to move beyond the primacy of the technical paradigm."
● "In contrast to the thrust of recent editorials, we argue that substantive progress in our 

field will not come from neuroscience and pharmaceuticals (important as these might be)
but from a fundamental re-examination of what mental healthcare is all about and a 

rethinking of how genuine knowledge and expertise can be developed in the field of 
mental health."

● "Overall, available evidence does not support the idea that antidepressants work by 

correcting a pre-existing 'chemical imbalance.28"

● "The evidence that non-specific factors, as opposed to specific techniques, account for 

nearly all the change in therapy is overwhelming."

● "The balance of evidence does not support the idea that mental health problems are 
best grasped through a technical idiom or that good mental health work can be 
characterised as a series of discrete interventions."

● "As Kirmayer & Gold put it recently 'Defining psychiatry as applied neuroscience 

valorizes the brain but urges on us a discipline that is both mindless and uncultured.57"

● "The evidence is becoming clear that to improve outcomes for our patients, we must 

focus more on contexts, relationships and the creation of services where the promotion 
of dignity, respect, meaning and engagement are prioritised."

● "Although some service users are happy to define themselves and their problems 

through a biomedical framework, many others are not. Such groups and individuals hold 
a variety of views, but are generally united by a rejection of the technological framework 
and the way it defines their problems through an expert vocabulary and logic."

● "In their study of users' views of services, Rogers et

 al64 found that many service users did not really value the technical expertise of the 
professionals. Instead, they were more concerned with the human aspects of their 
encounters such as being listened to, taken seriously, and treated with dignity, kindness 
and respect."

● "Psychiatry is not neurology; it is not a medicine of the brain. Although mental health 
problems undoubtedly have a biological dimension, in their very nature they reach 
beyond the brain to involve social, cultural and psychological dimensions."

● "The evidence base is telling us that we need a radical shift in our understanding of what

is at the heart (and perhaps soul) of mental health practice."

● "A post-technological psychiatry will not abandon the tools of empirical science or reject 
medical and psychotherapeutic techniques but will start to position the ethical and 
hermeneutic aspects of our work as primary, thereby highlighting the importance of 
examining values, relationships, politics and the ethical basis of care and caring."
● "We will never have a biomedical science that is similar to hepatology or respiratory 

medicine, not because we are bad doctors, but because the issues we deal with are of a
different nature."

● "Retreating to an even more biomedical identity will not only sell our patients short, but 

risks leading the profession down a single narrow alley, when what is needed is 
openness to alternative routes."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Recent meta-analyses of drug treatments for depression demonstrate that drug-placebo 
differences are minimal. Even in more severely depressed individuals, the differences 
are small and may result from decreased placebo responsiveness.

● A review of studies on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) found that none discovered 
significant differences between real and sham ECT after the treatment period.

● Evidence on psychotherapy shows non-specific factors (like client variables, relationship 
variables, and placebo effects) account for about 85% of the variance in therapeutic 
outcomes.

● A review of over 5,000 cases in the UK's National Health Service found no significant 
difference in outcomes based on the specific psychotherapeutic model used; the 
therapeutic relationship was the key factor.

● A meta-analysis of first- and second-generation antipsychotics found that improvements 

on standard rating scales were "disappointingly limited."

● In the UK alone, there are an estimated 300 service user groups with approximately 

9,000 members.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Technological Paradigm (Critique)

Since the 19th century, psychiatry has operated as if mental health problems can be understood
with the same biomedical tools used for physical organs like the liver or lungs. The modern 
"technological paradigm" continues this approach, incorporating cognitive psychology models 
like "information processing". It rests on the following assumptions:

● (a) Mental health problems come from faulty physiological or psychological mechanisms 

within an individual.

● (b) These mechanisms can be modeled in causal terms and are not dependent on 

context.

● (c) Interventions are technological tools that can be studied independently of 

relationships and values.
Under this paradigm, mental health issues are categorized with the same logic as other 
medical conditions, and interventions are seen as discrete treatments for specific 
syndromes. Important factors like relationships, values, and cultural beliefs become 
secondary concerns.

The Recovery Approach

The "recovery approach" is an influential movement away from the technological paradigm. It 
appreciates that personally meaningful recovery is not necessarily linked to the specific 
prescribed treatments. Key elements include:

● The importance of the

 therapeutic alliance in determining outcomes.

● The significance of

 self-esteem and an "internal locus of control".

● Creating a therapeutic context that fosters

 empowerment, connectedness, and a positive self-identity.

● Evidence from non-Western settings shows that people recover through many different 

pathways, highlighting the need to respect
 diversity in mental health work.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Collaboration with the Service User Movement

Effective service user organizations began to emerge in the 1980s and have since become a 
worldwide movement consulted by governments and global health organizations. Many of these
groups reject the technological framework's expert-defined vocabulary and logic.

● A key example is the

 Hearing Voices Network (HVN), which started in the Netherlands. It functions as a 
peer-support organization and offers an alternative way of understanding and 
responding to the experience of hearing voices.

● Other organizations, like

 Mind Freedom International and the Icarus Project, offer peer support while actively 
challenging the dominant psychopathological framework.

A Post-Technological Psychiatry

The authors argue for a new approach that goes beyond simply adding more social science to 
training. This "post-technological psychiatry" would:

● Not abandon empirical science, medical techniques, or psychotherapy.
● Position the

 ethical and hermeneutic aspects of the work—examining values, relationships, and 
politics—as primary.

● Involve active engagement with the

 complex nature of mental health problems, a healthy skepticism for biological 
reductionism, and a tolerance for the "tangled nature of relationships and meanings".

● Focus on skills in working with

 multiple layers of knowledge and many systems of meaning as the core of the 
practice, rather than seeking a biomedical science similar to other fields of medicine.
