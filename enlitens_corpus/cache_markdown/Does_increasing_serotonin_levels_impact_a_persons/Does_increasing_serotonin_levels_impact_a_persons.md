Yes, increasing serotonin levels is associated with greater social adaptation and
suggestibility, but the effect is context-dependent and varies by receptor subtype
and social situation.

1. Introduction

Serotonin (5-HT) is a key neuromodulator implicated in social behavior, adaptation, and sensitivity to social

influence. Recent research demonstrates that increasing serotonin activity—particularly through stimulation of the

5-HT2A receptor—can enhance a person's susceptibility to social influence and persuasion, especially when the
opinions or behaviors of others are similar to one's own (Duerler et al., 2020; Duerler et al., 2022). This effect is

observed in both human and animal studies, with pharmacological manipulations (e.g., LSD, MDMA, tryptophan

supplementation) increasing social adaptation, prosocial behavior, and conformity under certain conditions
(Duerler et al., 2020; Duerler et al., 2022; Esaki et al., 2023; Holze et al., 2021; Morley et al., 2005; Norden et al.,

2024; Young & Leyton, 2002). However, the relationship is nuanced: serotonin's impact on social influence is

context-dependent, influenced by the degree of social conflict, individual differences, and the specific receptor
subtypes involved (Duerler et al., 2020; Duerler et al., 2022; Preller et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2023; Kiser et al., 2012;

Kanen et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2022; Way & Taylor, 2010; Roberts et al., 2020).

Some studies also highlight that serotonin can modulate social emotions and dominance, further affecting how

individuals respond to social cues and persuasion (Collins et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2023; Kanen
et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Norden et al., 2024; Young & Leyton, 2002). This review synthesizes the evidence on

how increasing serotonin levels impacts susceptibility to social influence and persuasion.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across more than 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search targeted serotonin levels, social influence, persuasion,
and related neurobiological mechanisms. In total, 1,006 papers were identified, 489 were screened, 170 were

deemed eligible, and the 20 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Serotonin and Social Adaptation

Pharmacological studies in humans show that increasing serotonin activity (e.g., via LSD, which stimulates 5-HT2A
receptors) enhances social adaptation and conformity, but primarily when the opinions of others are similar to one's

own (Duerler et al., 2020; Duerler et al., 2022). This effect is associated with increased activity in the medial

prefrontal cortex during social feedback, and is blocked by 5-HT2A antagonists (Duerler et al., 2020). Similarly,
MDMA and tryptophan supplementation, which increase serotonin, are linked to increased prosocial behavior and

social dominance (Esaki et al., 2023; Young & Leyton, 2002).

3.2. Receptor Subtypes and Social Behavior

Different serotonin receptor subtypes play distinct roles in social influence. The 5-HT2A receptor is particularly
important for social adaptation and suggestibility (Duerler et al., 2020; Duerler et al., 2022; Preller et al., 2016). The

5-HT1A receptor in the amygdala and other brain regions is implicated in prosocial effects and social hierarchy

(Jiang et al., 2023; Esaki et al., 2023). Modulation of 5-HT2C receptors in the insular cortex also affects social
affective decision-making (Ng et al., 2023).

2 / 8

3.3. Context-Dependence and Individual Differences

The impact of serotonin on social influence is context-dependent. Increased serotonin enhances adaptation when

social conflict is low, but may reduce the motivation to conform when there is strong disagreement with group
norms (Duerler et al., 2020; Duerler et al., 2022). Individual differences, such as personality traits and genetic

polymorphisms (e.g., 5-HTTLPR), further modulate sensitivity to social influence (Kiser et al., 2012; Way & Taylor,

2010).

3.4. Social Emotions, Dominance, and Memory

Serotonin also modulates social emotions (e.g., guilt, empathy), social dominance, and social memory, which can

indirectly affect susceptibility to persuasion (Collins et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2023; Kanen et al.,

2019; Wu et al., 2021; Norden et al., 2024; Young & Leyton, 2002). For example, serotonin depletion amplifies social
emotions, and higher serotonin is linked to increased sociability and dominance (Kanen et al., 2019; Norden et al.,

2024; Young & Leyton, 2002).

4. Discussion

The evidence supports a significant, but nuanced, role for serotonin in modulating susceptibility to social influence
and persuasion. Increasing serotonin—especially via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation—can enhance social adaptation

and suggestibility, but this effect is strongest when social conflict is low and opinions are similar (Duerler et al.,

2020; Duerler et al., 2022). The effect is mediated by changes in brain regions involved in social cognition, such as

the medial prefrontal cortex (Duerler et al., 2020). Other receptor subtypes (5-HT1A, 5-HT2C) and brain regions

(amygdala, insula) also contribute to prosocial effects and social decision-making (Ng et al., 2023; Jiang et al.,
2023; Esaki et al., 2023). Individual differences and context (e.g., group similarity, social conflict) are critical

moderators (Kiser et al., 2012; Way & Taylor, 2010). While serotonin generally promotes prosocial behavior and

adaptation, it can also amplify social emotions and dominance, which may increase or decrease susceptibility to

persuasion depending on the situation (Collins et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2023; Kanen et al., 2019;

Wu et al., 2021; Norden et al., 2024; Young & Leyton, 2002). Limitations include the reliance on pharmacological

models (e.g., psychedelics, MDMA), which may not fully generalize to everyday social influence, and the need for
more research in diverse populations and real-world contexts.

5. Conclusion

Increasing serotonin levels, especially via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation, is associated with greater social adaptation

and suggestibility, but the effect is context-dependent and influenced by receptor subtype, social situation, and

individual differences.
