Epistemic Trust and Willingness to Engage with Challenging Ideas: A Structured
Literature Review

1. Introduction

Epistemic trust—the willingness to regard information from others as trustworthy and relevant—has emerged as a

key factor in how individuals engage with challenging or novel ideas. Research suggests that epistemic trust

facilitates openness to new information, supports productive argumentation, and underpins social learning, while

epistemic mistrust or credulity can hinder adaptive engagement with dissenting or complex perspectives (Novaes,

2020; Campbell et al., 2021; Liotti et al., 2023; Fonagy et al., 2019; Fonagy & Allison, 2023; Hendriks et al., 2015;

Vaupotič et al., 2024; Vaupotič et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2019; Chevrier et al., 2019). The literature highlights that

epistemic trust is not simply a matter of gullibility; rather, it involves a selective openness that enables individuals to

consider, evaluate, and potentially revise their beliefs in light of new or conflicting evidence (Novaes, 2020;

Campbell et al., 2021; Fonagy & Allison, 2023; Hendriks et al., 2015). Conversely, epistemic mistrust is associated

with rigidity, resistance to change, and difficulties in benefiting from social communication (Liotti et al., 2023;

Fonagy et al., 2019; Fonagy et al., 2015; Fonagy et al., 2017). This review synthesizes current research on the

relationship between epistemic trust and a person's willingness to engage with challenging ideas, drawing on

empirical, theoretical, and clinical perspectives.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including sources

such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8 thematic

clusters, focusing on epistemic trust, openness to challenging ideas, intellectual humility, and related constructs. In
total, 1,032 papers were identified, 564 were screened, 424 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant

papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Defining Epistemic Trust and Its Dimensions

Epistemic trust is conceptualized as an adaptive stance of selective openness to socially transmitted knowledge,

distinct from both mistrust (rejection of information) and credulity (uncritical acceptance) (Campbell et al., 2021;

Liotti et al., 2023; Fonagy & Allison, 2023; Hendriks et al., 2015). Validated measures such as the Epistemic Trust,

Mistrust, and Credulity Questionnaire (ETMCQ) have established its multidimensional nature and links to

psychological well-being (Campbell et al., 2021; Liotti et al., 2023; Greiner et al., 2025).

3.2. Epistemic Trust and Engagement with Challenging Ideas

High epistemic trust is associated with a greater willingness to engage in argumentation, consider opposing

viewpoints, and revise beliefs in light of new evidence (Novaes, 2020; Fonagy & Allison, 2023; Hendriks et al., 2015;

Vaupotič et al., 2024; Vaupotič et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2019; Chevrier et al., 2019). Trust in the epistemic

competence and integrity of information sources is crucial for productive engagement with challenging or

controversial ideas (Novaes, 2020; Hendriks et al., 2015; Vaupotič et al., 2024; Vaupotič et al., 2021; Tong et al.,

2019). Conversely, epistemic mistrust leads to avoidance, rigidity, and reduced openness to intellectual risk-taking
(Liotti et al., 2023; Fonagy et al., 2019; Fonagy et al., 2015; Fonagy et al., 2017).

3.3. Mechanisms and Moderators

The relationship between epistemic trust and openness is mediated by factors such as mentalizing (the ability to
understand others' mental states), attachment security, and prior experiences of social communication (Campbell

et al., 2021; Fonagy et al., 2019; Fonagy & Allison, 2023; Locati et al., 2022; Greiner et al., 2025). Cultural,

developmental, and contextual factors also shape epistemic stance and its impact on engagement with challenging
ideas (Liotti et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2019; Hendriks et al., 2015; Vaupotič et al., 2024; Vaupotič et al., 2021;

Schwarzenegger, 2020).

3.4. Implications for Education, Science Communication, and Psychotherapy

Fostering epistemic trust is seen as a goal in education and science communication, as it supports critical thinking,

intellectual humility, and the ability to navigate complex or conflicting information (Vaupotič et al., 2024; Vaupotič
et al., 2021; Chevrier et al., 2019; Greene & Yu, 2016). In psychotherapy, restoring epistemic trust is linked to

increased openness, resilience, and the capacity to benefit from social learning (Fonagy et al., 2019; Fonagy et al.,

2015; Fonagy & Allison, 2023; Nolte et al., 2023; Fisher et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022).

4. Discussion

The literature consistently demonstrates that epistemic trust is a key enabler of openness to challenging ideas,

argumentation, and intellectual growth (Novaes, 2020; Campbell et al., 2021; Liotti et al., 2023; Fonagy & Allison,

2023; Hendriks et al., 2015; Vaupotič et al., 2024; Vaupotič et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2019; Chevrier et al., 2019).

Individuals with high epistemic trust are more likely to engage with dissenting views, consider disconfirming

evidence, and adapt their beliefs, while those with epistemic mistrust tend to be rigid, avoidant, and less receptive
to new information (Liotti et al., 2023; Fonagy et al., 2019; Fonagy et al., 2015; Fonagy et al., 2017). The

development and restoration of epistemic trust are influenced by early attachment, mentalizing capacity, and social

context, suggesting that interventions targeting these factors may enhance openness and resilience (Campbell et

al., 2021; Fonagy et al., 2019; Fonagy & Allison, 2023; Locati et al., 2022; Greiner et al., 2025).

However, the relationship is not unidimensional; excessive credulity can also undermine critical engagement,

highlighting the importance of balanced, selective trust (Campbell et al., 2021; Liotti et al., 2023; Hendriks et al.,

2015). Some critiques caution against overemphasizing trust at the expense of epistemic vigilance, especially in

environments with misinformation or low-quality sources (Novaes, 2020; Hendriks et al., 2015; John, 2018). The

evidence base is strongest in clinical and developmental contexts, with growing but still limited empirical work in
education, science communication, and broader social domains.

5. Conclusion

Epistemic trust is a foundational factor in a person's willingness to engage with challenging ideas, supporting

openness, argumentation, and intellectual growth. Its development is shaped by psychological, social, and

contextual factors, and its absence is linked to rigidity and reduced adaptability. While the evidence is robust in

clinical and developmental domains, further research is needed to clarify mechanisms and interventions in

educational, scientific, and societal contexts.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite substantial progress, gaps remain in understanding how epistemic trust operates across diverse

populations, contexts, and domains. There is a need for more empirical studies outside clinical settings, longitudinal

research on the development of epistemic trust, and interventions to foster balanced trust and openness.
