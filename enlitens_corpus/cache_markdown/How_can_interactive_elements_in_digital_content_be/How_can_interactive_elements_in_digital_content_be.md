How Interactive Elements in Digital Content Can Increase Information Retention:
A Comprehensive Review

1. Introduction

Interactive elements in digital content—such as quizzes, branching scenarios, gamification, augmented reality, and

embodied activities—have been widely studied for their potential to enhance information retention. Research

consistently shows that interactivity supports deeper engagement, active learning, and improved memory retention

compared to passive or linear digital formats (Hung et al., 2018; Afify, 2020; Tarigan et al., 2023; Lin & Yu, 2023;

Duterte, 2024; Putz et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2017; Smirani & Yamani, 2024; Krause et al., 2015; Shelton et al., 2016;

Zhang et al., 2006; Zhang, 2005; Haerawan et al., 2024; Okano et al., 2018; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024). Mechanisms

underlying these benefits include increased learner control, timely feedback, multisensory engagement, and

opportunities for retrieval practice. However, the effectiveness of interactive elements depends on thoughtful

design, alignment with learning objectives, and consideration of cognitive load (Afify, 2020; Xie et al., 2017;

Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Thees et al., 2020). This review synthesizes evidence from experimental studies, meta-

analyses, and systematic reviews to clarify how and when interactive digital content can best support information

retention.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The search strategy involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8 thematic

clusters, focusing on interactive digital content, information retention, cognitive load, gamification, multimedia

learning, and related constructs. In total, 1,039 papers were identified, 819 were screened, 656 were deemed
eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1. Types of Interactive Elements and Their Effects

Interactive elements include embodied activities (e.g., gesture-based learning), interactive videos with embedded

questions, gamified modules, augmented/virtual reality, and adaptive feedback systems. Studies show that these

elements, when well-designed, significantly improve comprehension and retention compared to non-interactive or

linear digital formats (Hung et al., 2018; Afify, 2020; Tarigan et al., 2023; Lin & Yu, 2023; Duterte, 2024; Putz et al.,

2020; Xie et al., 2017; Smirani & Yamani, 2024; Krause et al., 2015; Shelton et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2006; Zhang,

2005; Haerawan et al., 2024; Okano et al., 2018; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024).

3.2. Mechanisms: Why Interactivity Enhances Retention

Interactivity promotes active engagement, retrieval practice, and multisensory learning, all of which are linked to

stronger memory formation (Hung et al., 2018; Afify, 2020; Tarigan et al., 2023; Lin & Yu, 2023; Duterte, 2024; Xie

et al., 2017; Smirani & Yamani, 2024; Krause et al., 2015; Shelton et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2006; Zhang, 2005;

Haerawan et al., 2024; Okano et al., 2018). Features such as immediate feedback, learner control, and

segmentation reduce cognitive overload and support deeper processing (Afify, 2020; Xie et al., 2017; Skulmowski &
Xu, 2021; Thees et al., 2020). Gamification and social elements further boost motivation and sustained attention,

indirectly supporting retention (Putz et al., 2020; Smirani & Yamani, 2024; Krause et al., 2015; Malicki et al., 2020;
Ekici, 2021; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024).

3.3. Evidence from Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews

Meta-analyses confirm that interactive digital content—especially augmented reality, gamification, and interactive

multimedia—yields moderate to large improvements in knowledge retention, critical thinking, and learner
motivation (Lin & Yu, 2023; Putz et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2017; Smirani & Yamani, 2024; Krause et al., 2015; Malicki et

al., 2020; Zhang, 2005; Ekici, 2021; Ødegaard et al., 2020; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024). However, the effect size

varies by context, learner characteristics, and the specific design of interactive features.

3.4. Limitations and Boundary Conditions

Not all interactive elements are equally effective. Poorly designed interactivity can increase cognitive load, distract
from learning objectives, or fail to improve retention (Afify, 2020; Xie et al., 2017; Tabbers et al., 2004; Geana et al.,

2023; , 2023; Jacob & Centofanti, 2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Thees et al., 2020). Some studies report no

significant gains or even negative effects when interactivity is excessive, misaligned, or not supported by adequate
scaffolding (Tabbers et al., 2004; Geana et al., 2023; , 2023; Jacob & Centofanti, 2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021;

Thees et al., 2020). Learner digital literacy, access, and motivation also moderate outcomes (Jacob & Centofanti,

2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024).

4. Discussion

The literature provides strong evidence that interactive elements in digital content can significantly increase

information retention, especially when they are thoughtfully designed and aligned with cognitive and motivational

principles (Hung et al., 2018; Afify, 2020; Tarigan et al., 2023; Lin & Yu, 2023; Duterte, 2024; Putz et al., 2020; Xie et

al., 2017; Smirani & Yamani, 2024; Krause et al., 2015; Shelton et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2006; Zhang, 2005;

Haerawan et al., 2024; Okano et al., 2018; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024). Mechanisms such as active engagement,

retrieval practice, feedback, and multisensory stimulation are central to these effects. However, the benefits are not
universal: excessive or poorly designed interactivity can increase cognitive load, distract learners, or fail to yield

retention gains (Afify, 2020; Xie et al., 2017; Tabbers et al., 2004; Geana et al., 2023; , 2023; Jacob & Centofanti,

2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Thees et al., 2020). The effectiveness of interactive elements is also moderated by

learner characteristics (e.g., digital literacy, motivation), context, and the specific learning objectives (Jacob &

Centofanti, 2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024).

Meta-analyses and large-scale studies confirm that gamification, augmented reality, and interactive multimedia are

particularly effective for boosting retention, motivation, and engagement (Lin & Yu, 2023; Putz et al., 2020; Xie et

al., 2017; Smirani & Yamani, 2024; Krause et al., 2015; Malicki et al., 2020; Zhang, 2005; Ekici, 2021; Ødegaard et al.,

2020; Guaña-Moya et al., 2024). However, some studies highlight the need for careful instructional design,
scaffolding, and accessibility considerations to ensure that all learners benefit (Afify, 2020; Xie et al., 2017; Tabbers

et al., 2004; Geana et al., 2023; , 2023; Jacob & Centofanti, 2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Thees et al., 2020).

5. Conclusion

Interactive elements in digital content—when well-designed and aligned with learning goals—can substantially
increase information retention by promoting active engagement, feedback, and multisensory learning. However,

their effectiveness depends on thoughtful instructional design, learner characteristics, and context.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for the benefits of interactivity, gaps remain in understanding which specific elements

work best for different learners, subjects, and contexts. More research is needed on long-term retention,

accessibility, and the impact of emerging technologies.
