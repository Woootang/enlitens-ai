DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This review by Frances A. Champagne details the process of "behavioral transmission," where 
parenting styles and their associated traits are passed across generations through experience 
rather than genetics. It presents a concrete biological mechanism for this phenomenon: 
variations in maternal care (in rats, primates, and humans) cause stable, epigenetic changes—
specifically, the methylation of DNA—in the brains of offspring. This process physically alters 
the expression of key genes like the estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors, which in turn shapes
the offspring's future behavior, stress reactivity, and their own parenting style, providing a 
powerful scientific basis for how lived experience, particularly in early life, becomes biologically 
embedded and transmitted.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"The transmission of traits across generations has typically been attributed to the inheritance by 
offspring of genomic information from parental generations. However, recent evidence suggests
that epigenetic mechanisms are capable of mediating this type of transmission."

"In the case of maternal care, there is evidence for the behavioral transmission of postpartum 
behavior from mothers to female offspring."

"Data from cross-fostering studies conducted in primates and rodents suggests that this 
inheritance is not genetic, in the sense that it is not mediated by sequence variations in DNA, 
but rather is behavioral, relying on the quality of the postpartum mother-infant interaction."

"However, regardless of whether the etiology of this transmission is genetic or behavioral there 
must ultimately be a neurobiological change in offspring that has consequences for the 
behavioral patterns displayed in adulthood."

"...'epigenetic', which can have many meanings, has come to refer to the changes in chromatin 
and DNA structure which alter gene expression and hence phenotype that do not involve 
changes to the sequence of DNA."

"Though the stability of these early environmental effects on maternal care has been clearly 
demonstrated there are social experiences that occur beyond the postnatal period that are 
capable of reversing these effects."

"In addition, rather than demonstrating a gene-environment interaction, these results provide 
evidence for an environment-environment interaction in which the epigenetic influences or early 
experiences interact with environmental conditions experienced later in development."

"Traditionally, definitions of inheritance have been limited to the passing of genetic information 
from one generation to the next. However, it is not simply the presence of genes but rather 
levels of gene expression that lead to individual variations in offspring characteristics."

"The Lamarckian theory that traits acquired in response to the environment experienced over 
the lifetime will be transmitted to offspring was initially overlooked as a potential mechanism of 
inheritance. However, current research on the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating 
environmentally induced changes in maternal care that are transmitted across generations 
provides a mechanisms though which Lamarckian inheritance is possible."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Transgenerational Abuse in Humans: It is estimated that up to 70% of abusive 

parents were themselves abused. Conversely, 20-30% of infants who are abused are 
likely to become abusers.

● Transgenerational Abuse in Primates: In rhesus macaques, over 50% of offspring 
who received abusive parenting during their first 6 months of life would then exhibit 
abusive parenting themselves as adults. Cross-fostering infants from abusive to non-
abusive mothers prevented this transmission, indicating a key role for the postnatal 
environment.

● Human Parenting Style and Mental Health: A parenting style described as 

'affectionless control' (low maternal care, high overprotection) is identified as a risk factor
for adult outcomes including depression, antisocial personality traits, anxiety disorders, 
and drug use.

● Human Parental Care and Biology: In non-clinical human subjects, those reporting 

high levels of maternal care had elevated self-esteem, reduced anxiety, and decreased 
salivary cortisol in response to stress. A significant negative correlation was found 
between cerebrospinal fluid levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and self-
reported levels of parental care.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Behavioral Transmission of Traits

This framework proposes that behaviors and their associated traits can be transmitted from one 
generation to the next through the experience of being parented, independent of genetic 
inheritance (i.e., DNA sequence). The quality of the mother-infant interaction in the postnatal 
period directly shapes the neurobiological development of the offspring, which in turn influences 
the behavior the offspring will exhibit as an adult, including their own parenting style. Cross-
fostering studies, where offspring are raised by non-biological mothers, provide the key 
evidence for this mechanism by showing that offspring adopt the behavioral phenotype of their 
adoptive parent, not their biological parent.

Epigenetic Regulation as the Mechanism for Behavioral Transmission

The paper posits that epigenetics is the molecular mechanism underlying behavioral 
transmission. The process is as follows:

1. Experience: An infant experiences a certain quality of maternal care (e.g., high vs. low 

levels of licking/grooming in rats).

2. Neurobiological Change: This experience leads to changes in neuroendocrine systems
and alters the activity of transcription factors (e.g., Stat5, NGF1-A) in specific brain 
regions like the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and hippocampus.

3. Epigenetic Modification: These changes in transcription factor activity lead to stable, 
long-term modifications to the genome, specifically the DNA methylation pattern of key 
gene promoters, such as the Estrogen Receptor α (ERα) and the Glucocorticoid 
Receptor (GR). For example, low maternal care leads to higher methylation (gene 
silencing) of the ERα promoter in the MPOA.

4. Altered Gene Expression: The altered methylation state changes the long-term 

expression level of these genes. A highly methylated ERα promoter leads to reduced 
ERα expression.

5. Altered Adult Behavior: The changes in gene expression lead to a different adult 

phenotype. Reduced ERα in the MPOA leads to reduced sensitivity to estrogen and 
oxytocin, resulting in lower maternal care behavior when that individual becomes a 
parent, thus completing the transgenerational cycle.

Environment-Environment Interaction

The paper proposes this concept to describe how the biological effects of the early-life 
environment can be modified by the environment experienced later in life. In rat studies, the 
differences in maternal behavior and neurobiology established by high or low maternal care in 
infancy were erased when the rats were housed in socially enriched or impoverished conditions 
after weaning. This suggests a high degree of plasticity, where the epigenetic programming 
from early life is not deterministic but interacts with later significant social experiences. This 
model contrasts with a simple gene-environment interaction by highlighting the interplay 
between two different environmental periods.

Lamarckian Inheritance

The paper concludes that epigenetic behavioral transmission is a valid mechanism for the 
inheritance of acquired traits, a concept central to Lamarckian theory. Traits that are "acquired" 
in response to the environment an individual experiences during their lifetime (e.g., a fearful 

phenotype resulting from poor maternal care in a stressful environment) can be transmitted to 
the next generation through the epigenetic programming of the offspring's brain and behavior.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

Human Findings

● Transmission of Abuse and Attachment: There is a documented transgenerational 
continuity of child abuse, with up to 70% of abusive parents having been abused 
themselves. A mother's attachment classification is a good predictor of her infant's 
attachment classification, an effect that has been observed across three generations.

● Institutional Rearing: Women who were raised in institutional settings without 

consistent parental care later display less sensitivity and more confrontational behavior 
towards their own children.

● Parental Bonding and Mental Health: Self-report studies using the Parental Bonding 

Index (PBI) show that a parenting style of 'affectionless control' (low care, high 
overprotection) is a risk factor for depression, anxiety disorders, antisocial personality 
traits, and drug use in adulthood. In contrast, high levels of reported maternal care are 
associated with higher self-esteem and dampened cortisol responses to stress.

● Infant Attachment and Later Psychopathology: Secure attachment in infancy is linked

to greater self-reliance, self-esteem, and emotional regulation later in life. Disorganized 
attachment is associated with the highest risk for later psychopathology, including 
dissociative disorders, aggression, and conduct disorder.

Primate Findings

● Transmission of Abusive Behavior: Studies in rhesus and pigtail macaques show that 
infant abuse is concentrated within certain matrilines (family lines through the mother). 
Over 50% of rhesus macaque offspring who were abused become abusive mothers 
themselves. This transmission is environmental, as cross-fostering an infant from an 
abusive to a non-abusive mother prevents the infant from becoming an abusive parent.

● Transmission of Non-Abusive Maternal Styles: In vervet monkeys, the best predictor 
of how much contact a mother has with her infant is the amount of contact she herself 
received as an infant. Maternal rejection rates are also transmitted across generations in
rhesus monkeys.

● Effects of Deprivation: Rhesus macaques reared in social isolation for the first 6 

months of life show severe impairments in their own maternal behavior, including high 
rates of abuse, neglect, and infanticide.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Reversibility of Early Life Effects

The research demonstrates that the effects of early life experiences, while stable, are not 
necessarily permanent. In rat studies, the negative developmental outcomes associated with 
low maternal care or the positive outcomes from high maternal care could be reversed by post-

weaning environmental conditions. Social enrichment (group housing) ameliorated the deficits in
offspring of low-care mothers, while social impoverishment (isolation) diminished the 
advantages seen in offspring of high-care mothers. This suggests that later-life interventions, 
particularly those involving social environments, can potentially modify the epigenetic and 
behavioral trajectories established in early life.

Importance of Tactile Stimulation

The paper highlights that while the specific form of care differs between species (e.g., 
licking/grooming in rats vs. holding in primates), tactile stimulation is a critical component of 
maternal care across mammals. In artificially-reared rats, providing tactile stimulation with a 
paintbrush improves later maternal behavior and reduces fearfulness. In premature human 
infants, tactile/kinesthetic stimulation leads to increased weight gain and improved 
developmental outcomes. This underscores the fundamental biological importance of physical 
contact for healthy development, with implications for practices in neonatal care and parenting 
support.

Understanding the Impact of Stress on Parenting

The paper details how environmental stress affects parenting quality, which in turn affects 
offspring development. In both primates and rodents, unpredictable food sources (a form of 
stress) led to disrupted mother-infant interactions and more fearful offspring with altered stress 
biology. In humans, maternal stress and depression are associated with decreased maternal 
responsivity and less physical contact with infants. This provides a clear framework for 
understanding how societal stressors can impact family systems and become biologically 
embedded in the next generation, highlighting the need for interventions that support parents 
experiencing stress.
