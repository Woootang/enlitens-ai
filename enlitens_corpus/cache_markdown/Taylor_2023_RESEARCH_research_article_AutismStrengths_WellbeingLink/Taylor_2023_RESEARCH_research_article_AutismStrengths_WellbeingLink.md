DOCUMENT SUMMARY This landmark study provides the first large-scale empirical evidence 
that for autistic people, using their personal strengths is a strong predictor of better quality of 
life, higher well-being, and better mental health (less anxiety, depression, and stress). The 
research challenges the notion of a uniform profile of "autistic strengths," finding that autistic 
and non-autistic people report similar strengths. This powerfully validates Enlitens' core mission 
to move beyond deficit-based models and focus on identifying and leveraging individual 
strengths to improve life outcomes.

Psychological strengths and well-being: 
Strengths use predicts quality of life, well-
being and mental health in autism

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper provides the crucial empirical evidence that underpins the entire Enlitens clinical 
model. While our approach has been philosophically and ethically sound, this study proves that 
the core mechanism—helping autistic people identify and use their strengths—is directly and 
strongly linked to better quality of life, well-being, and mental health. It moves the conversation 
about strengths-based care from a "nice idea" to an evidence-based imperative.

Furthermore, the paper's finding that there are few "autism-specific" strengths is revolutionary. It
frees us from the trap of stereotypes (e.g., all autistic people are good at math or tech) and 
validates our focus on the unique, individual constellation of strengths each person possesses. 
This research is foundational; it gives us the data to show that our approach is not just affirming,
but is a key pathway to improving the lives of our clients.

Critical Statistics and Findings for Our Work

● Strengths Use Predicts Well-being: In autistic people, greater use of their strengths 

was a strong predictor of better quality of life across physical, psychological, social, and 

environmental domains; higher subjective well-being; and lower levels of depression, 
anxiety, and stress.

● Strength of the Effect: Strengths use had a larger and opposite effect on well-being 
outcomes compared to the negative impact of being autistic. Autistic people with high 
strengths use reported better outcomes than non-autistic people with low strengths use.

● Lower Strengths Knowledge and Use: Autistic people reported significantly lower 

knowledge of their strengths and used their strengths less frequently compared to their 
non-autistic peers.

● No "Autistic Strengths" Profile: Autistic and non-autistic participants reported similar 
strengths. Of 25 commonly cited "autistic strengths," only one (pattern recognition) was 
endorsed more by the autistic group. In contrast, the non-autistic group more strongly 
endorsed eight of these traits, including empathy, organization, focus, and 
communication.

● Universal Benefit: The positive relationship between using one's strengths and having 
better life outcomes was the same for both autistic and non-autistic people, suggesting a
universal psychological mechanism.

Methodology We Can Learn From

This study serves as a model for rigorous, affirming research.

1. Community Involvement: The study was co-developed with autistic adults, following 

participatory research guidelines to ensure the research questions, design, and 
interpretation were relevant and appropriate for the community.

2. Well-Matched Groups: It used a large sample of 276 adults and carefully matched the 

autistic and non-autistic groups on age, sex, and general cognitive ability, which 
increases the validity of the findings and is often a limitation in other studies.

3. Online Recruitment: Recruiting participants online allowed for a more heterogeneous 
sample with diverse educational and employment backgrounds, reaching individuals 
who might not participate in in-person research.

4. Validated Measures: The study used validated scales for measuring strengths 
knowledge and use (Strengths Knowledge Scale, Strengths Use Scale) and 
demonstrated their reliability within an autistic sample for the first time.

Findings That Challenge the System

Moving Beyond the "Autistic Strengths" Stereotype

The paper strongly challenges the common practice of focusing on a narrow set of supposed 
"autistic strengths."

● Stereotypes are Inaccurate: The data shows that generalizations about the strengths 

of the autistic population are likely inaccurate. Autistic people have diverse strengths that
they share with their non-autistic peers.

● Potential for Harm: Highlighting supposed "autistic strengths," for instance in 

employment initiatives, may do more harm than good for autistic individuals who do not 
fit these stereotypes. It creates unrealistic expectations and inappropriately attributes an 
individual's abilities to their autism diagnosis.

● A More Inclusive Approach: The authors recommend moving away from the term 

"autistic strengths" and instead appreciating the similarities between autistic and non-
autistic people and their diverse, but not necessarily unique, strengths. This can help 
build cohesion and challenge the unhelpful idea that autistic people must offer unique 
strengths to be valued by society.

The Power of a Strengths-Based Model

This research provides powerful evidence against deficit-focused models by showing that 
strengths are not just a feel-good concept, but a crucial protective factor.

● Overcoming Difficulties: Strengths use could help overcome the lower quality of life 

and well-being often associated with autism.

● A Protective Factor: Using strengths may serve as an important protective factor 

against the development of co-occurring psychiatric conditions.

● Mechanism of Well-being: The authors suggest that, as in non-autistic populations, 

using strengths likely boosts well-being by increasing feelings of self-worth, positive 
affect, and self-esteem.

Quotes We Might Use

● "...strengths use in autism strongly predicted better quality of life, subjective well-being, 

and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress."

● "...autistic people who reported using their strengths often had better quality of life, well-
being and mental health than autistic people who reported using their strengths less 
frequently."

● "...we recommend moving away from the term 'autistic strengths' and their specific 

incorporation into interventions, towards acknowledging the many diverse strengths 
autistic people have but share with their non-autistic peers."

● "...generalizations regarding strengths of autistic populations, as a whole, are likely 

inaccurate and may promote stereotypes of autistic people."

● "Critically, similarly to non-autistic people, strengths use by autistic people was strongly 
associated with positive outcomes, including better quality of life, subjective well-being, 
and mental health."

● "...autistic people with high strengths use had better outcomes than non-autistic people 

with low strengths use."

Clinical Implications

This study has direct and significant implications for how we structure therapy and support for 
autistic individuals.

● Focus on Strengths Use: The primary goal of interventions should be to increase the 

use of an individual's personal strengths, as this is strongly linked to well-being.
● Address Barriers: Since autistic people report lower strengths use, it is critical to 

understand and address the barriers they face. These may be internal (e.g., difficulty 
identifying opportunities) or external (e.g., lack of employment opportunities, societal 
attitudes). Interventions will have little impact if external barriers are not addressed.

● Individualize, Don't Stereotype: Interventions should focus on an individual's general 

strengths, not a narrow, preconceived list of "autistic strengths".

● Adapt Existing Interventions: Since the positive effects of strengths use are similar in 

autistic and non-autistic people, it may be effective and efficient to adapt existing, 
evidence-based strengths interventions from the general population for autistic 
individuals, rather than creating new programs from scratch.

● Build Strengths Knowledge: Given that autistic people report lower knowledge of their 
strengths, and this is linked to lower use, a key first step in any intervention is to help 
them identify and understand what they do best.
