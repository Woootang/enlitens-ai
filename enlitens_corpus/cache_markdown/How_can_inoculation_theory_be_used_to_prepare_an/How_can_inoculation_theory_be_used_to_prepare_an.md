Yes, inoculation theory can be used to prepare audiences to resist misinformation
by preemptively exposing them to weakened forms of misleading arguments and
teaching them how to recognize and refute manipulative techniques.

1. Introduction

Inoculation theory, originally developed in the 1960s, is a psychological framework that likens resistance to

persuasion to the way vaccines build immunity to viruses. By exposing individuals to a "weakened dose" of

misinformation—such as common manipulation techniques or misleading arguments—along with refutations,

audiences develop cognitive "antibodies" that help them recognize and resist future misinformation (Traberg et al.,

2022; Lewandowsky & Van Der Linden, 2021; Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Van Der Linden, 2023; Lu et al., 2023;

Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Van Der Linden et al., 2017). Recent research demonstrates that

inoculation interventions, including games, videos, and narrative-based messages, can significantly improve

people’s ability to spot misinformation, reduce its perceived credibility, and decrease the likelihood of sharing false

content (Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2023;

Neylan et al., 2023; Biddlestone et al., 2022). These effects are robust across various topics (e.g., health, climate

change, politics), delivery formats (active vs. passive), and populations, though their longevity and scalability can

vary (Maertens et al., 2020; Maertens et al., 2025; Maertens et al., 2020; Green et al., 2022; McPhedran et al.,

2023; Jiang et al., 2022; Piltch-Loeb et al., 2021; Trecek-King & Cook, 2024; Hopkins et al., 2023; Traberg et al.,

2024; Linden & Roozenbeek, 2020; Roozenbeek et al., 2020; Biddlestone et al., 2025; Van Der Linden et al., 2017).
Inoculation is now widely recognized as a promising, scalable, and cost-effective strategy for building societal

resilience against misinformation.

2. Methods

3. Results

3.1 Core Mechanisms of Inoculation

Inoculation interventions typically include two components: (1) a forewarning of an impending persuasive attack
(threat), and (2) exposure to weakened arguments or manipulative techniques, along with refutations (refutational

preemption) (Traberg et al., 2022; Lewandowsky & Van Der Linden, 2021; Van Der Linden, 2023; Roozenbeek et al.,

2022; Green et al., 2022; Van Der Linden et al., 2017; Compton et al., 2016). This process motivates individuals to
generate counterarguments and increases their resistance to future misinformation.

3.2 Formats and Delivery Methods

Inoculation can be delivered through various formats:

•

•

•

Passive: Audiences receive information about manipulation techniques and refutations (e.g., videos,
infographics) (Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Green et al., 2022; Basol et al.,

2020; Piltch-Loeb et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2023; Biddlestone et al., 2025; Neylan et al., 2023).

Active: Audiences actively engage in generating counterarguments or identifying misinformation (e.g., games
like "Bad News," interactive workshops) (Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Trecek-King & Cook, 2024;

Hu et al., 2023; Hopkins et al., 2023; Linden & Roozenbeek, 2020; Roozenbeek et al., 2020; Neylan et al., 2023).

Experiential: Audiences are misled and then debriefed, enhancing learning through experience (Trecek-King &
Cook, 2024).

Active and experiential formats often yield stronger and longer-lasting effects than passive ones (Green et al.,

2022; Trecek-King & Cook, 2024; Hu et al., 2023; Hopkins et al., 2023).

2 / 11

3.3 Effectiveness and Longevity

Meta-analyses and large-scale studies show that inoculation interventions:

•

•

•

•

Reduce the perceived credibility and sharing of misinformation (Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023;
Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2023; Buczel et al., 2022; Neylan et al., 2023; Biddlestone

et al., 2022).

Improve the ability to discern trustworthy from untrustworthy content (Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023;
Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2023; Buczel et al., 2022; Neylan et al., 2023; Biddlestone

et al., 2022).

Are effective across topics (health, climate, politics), delivery formats, and populations (Roozenbeek et al.,
2022; Maertens et al., 2020; Green et al., 2022; McPhedran et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2022; Piltch-Loeb et al.,

2021; Trecek-King & Cook, 2024; Hopkins et al., 2023; Traberg et al., 2024; Linden & Roozenbeek, 2020;

Roozenbeek et al., 2020; Biddlestone et al., 2025; Van Der Linden et al., 2017).

Effects can last from weeks to months, but may decay over time without booster interventions (Maertens et al.,

2020; Maertens et al., 2025; Maertens et al., 2020; Green et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2023;

Hopkins et al., 2023; Biddlestone et al., 2025).

3.4 Limitations and Challenges

Challenges include:

•

•

•

•

Scalability: Passive interventions (e.g., short videos) are more scalable but may be less effective than active

ones (Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023; Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Johnson & Madsen, 2024; Green et al.,
2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2023; Hopkins et al., 2023; Biddlestone et al., 2025; Neylan et al., 2023).

Engagement: Some audiences may be hesitant to engage with inoculation interventions, especially if they

perceive themselves as less vulnerable to misinformation or distrust the source (Johnson & Madsen, 2024;
Harjani et al., 2023).

Cultural and contextual adaptation: Effectiveness can vary across cultures and platforms, requiring tailored

approaches (Hopkins et al., 2023; Traberg et al., 2024; Bessarabova et al., 2024; Harjani et al., 2023).

Decay of effects: Without reinforcement, the protective effects of inoculation may diminish over time

(Maertens et al., 2020; Maertens et al., 2025; Maertens et al., 2020; Green et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et

al., 2023; Hopkins et al., 2023; Biddlestone et al., 2025).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports the use of inoculation theory as a proactive, scalable, and effective strategy for

preparing audiences to resist misinformation (Traberg et al., 2022; Lewandowsky & Van Der Linden, 2021;
Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Van Der Linden, 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Van Der

Linden et al., 2017; Compton et al., 2016). By forewarning individuals and exposing them to weakened forms of

manipulative techniques, inoculation interventions foster critical thinking, increase skepticism toward misleading

content, and reduce the likelihood of misinformation spreading (Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023;

Roozenbeek et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2023; Buczel et al., 2022; Neylan et al., 2023; Biddlestone et

al., 2022). Active and experiential formats, such as games and interactive workshops, tend to produce stronger and
longer-lasting effects than passive formats, though passive interventions are more scalable (Green et al., 2022;

Trecek-King & Cook, 2024; Hu et al., 2023; Hopkins et al., 2023; Biddlestone et al., 2025).

However, challenges remain in scaling interventions, maintaining long-term effects, and adapting strategies to

diverse audiences and cultural contexts (Maertens et al., 2020; Maertens et al., 2025; Johnson & Madsen, 2024;

Maertens et al., 2020; Green et al., 2022; Basol et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2023; Hopkins et al., 2023; Traberg et al.,

2024; Bessarabova et al., 2024; Biddlestone et al., 2025; Harjani et al., 2023). Engagement and trust in the source of
inoculation messages are also critical for success (Johnson & Madsen, 2024; Harjani et al., 2023). Booster

interventions and integration with media literacy programs may help sustain and amplify the protective effects

(Maertens et al., 2025; Lahiri, 2024; Trecek-King & Cook, 2024; Hopkins et al., 2023; Biddlestone et al., 2025).

5. Conclusion

Inoculation theory provides a robust, evidence-based framework for preparing audiences to resist misinformation.
By preemptively exposing people to weakened forms of manipulative techniques and teaching them how to refute

them, inoculation interventions can significantly reduce susceptibility to misinformation, improve discernment, and
decrease the spread of false content. The most effective interventions are active, engaging, and tailored to the

audience, but scalable passive formats also show promise.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence, gaps remain in understanding the long-term durability of inoculation effects, optimal
delivery formats for diverse populations, and strategies for scaling interventions globally. More research is needed
on booster interventions, cultural adaptation, and integration with other media literacy efforts.
