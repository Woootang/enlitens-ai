DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a foundational scientific paper by Mottron et al. (2006) that proposes 
and updates the "Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF)" model for understanding 
autism. As an alternative to the Weak Central Coherence (WCC) theory, the EPF 
model posits that autistic perception is not deficient but is characterized by a superior 
and more prominent role in cognition. The paper outlines eight principles of autistic 
perception, including a default local orientation, superior performance in low-level 
discrimination tasks, and an atypical reliance on posterior brain regions. It argues that 
this perceptual style can explain both the challenges and the unique strengths, including
savant abilities, seen in the autistic population.

Enhanced Perceptual Functioning in Autism: An Update, 
and Eight Principles of Autistic Perception

Laurent Mottron, Michelle Dawson, Isabelle Soulières, Benedicte Hubert, and Jake
Burack

We propose an "Enhanced Perceptual Functioning" model encompassing
the main differences between autistic and non-autistic social and non-social 
perceptual processing: locally oriented visual and auditory perception, 
enhanced low-level discrimination, use of a more posterior network in 
"complex" visual tasks, enhanced perception of first order static stimuli, 
diminished perception of complex movement, autonomy of low-level 
information processing toward higher-order operations, and differential 
relation between perception and general intelligence.

INTRODUCTION

The aim of this paper is to update the Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) model
originally proposed (Mottron & Burack, 2001) as a framework within which the 
perceptual characteristics of autistic persons could be understood. This model was 
proposed in alternative to the prevailing model of perceptual functioning in autism at the 
time, the Weak Central Coherence model (WCC).

According to the EPF model, superiority of perceptual flow of information in comparison 
to higher-order operations led to an atypical relationship between high and low order 
cognitive processes in autism, by making perceptual processes more difficult to control 
and more disruptive to the development of other behaviors and abilities.

Our contribution was to emphasize that perception was not intact, in the sense of 
"similar to that of non-autistics", but superior to that of non-autistics in absolute 
performance and relative involvement in laboratory and ecological settings.

The Updated EPF Model: Eight Principles of Autistic Perception

Principle 1: The Default Setting of Autistic Perception is more Locally Oriented 
than that of Non-autistics

Autistics display a constant pattern of enhanced performance in tasks like the block 
design (BD) task and the Embedded Figures Task (EFT). When the processing of a 
global aspect conflicts with a local analysis among typically developing persons, 
autistics perform at a level superior to their comparison groups.

In sum, these findings... appear surprisingly consistent... The default setting of the 
autistic perceptual system toward local information contrasts with typical hierarchical 
processing that combines "global advantage”, the superior relative speed and 
accuracy of global target detection, with “global interference", the asymmetric 
influence of global processing on the detection of the local stimuli.

Principle 2: Increased Gradient of Neural Complexity is Inversely Related to Level 
of Performance in Low-Level Perceptual Tasks

This pattern of findings displays a striking contrast with the evidence of superior 
performance by autistic persons on static, “simple” discrimination tasks. For example, 
Plaisted et al. (1998a) demonstrated enhanced discrimination of novel, highly similar 
stimuli. Bertone et al. (2005) studied orientation-identification thresholds and found that 
high-functioning autistics (HFA) were better able to identify the orientation of simple, 
first-order gratings, but less able to identify the orientation of complex, second-order 
gratings. This pattern is also seen in the auditory modality, with enhanced discrimination
of pure tones.

This aligns with the underconnectivity hypothesis (UCH), which suggests that long-
range neural connections required for higher-level processes may be impaired in 
autism, while short-range, intraregional connections within low-level perceptual areas 
may be preserved or even superior (local overconnectivity).

Principle 3: Early Atypical Behaviors have a Regulatory Function Toward 
Perceptual Input

Atypical visual exploratory behaviors for inanimate objects date to the first description of
autism. We found that the most frequent atypical visual behaviors among 15 autistic 
toddlers were lateral glances, mostly oriented toward moving stimuli. Detail perception 
being enhanced (principle 1) and movement perception being diminished (principle 2) in
autistic adults, we interpreted the high prevalence of lateral glances among autistic 
toddlers as an early attempt to limit otherwise excessive amounts of information and/or 
to focus on optimal information for a given task.

Principle 4: Perceptual Primary and Associative Brain Regions are Atypically 
Activated During Social and Non-Social Tasks

Findings from functional imaging studies consistently indicate that, despite typical levels
of performance, autistics display an enhanced activation of visuo-perceptual regions 
(occipital or occipito-temporal) in association with a diminished activation in regions that 
are devoted to “higher order" (frontal) or "socially relevant" (e.g.: fusiform face area or 
FFA) tasks among non-autistics. This pattern is observed in both perceptual and non-
perceptual tasks and for both social and non-social stimuli.

Principle 5: Higher-order Processing is Optional in Autism and Mandatory in Non-
Autistics

The versatility of the influence that high level perception exercises on low-level 
perception in autism contrasts with the mandatory laws of global precedence, gestalt 
laws, or categorization effects observed among typical individuals. Autistics have 
access to physically accurate or psychologically distorted representations dependent 
upon the cue in the question. This indicates that autistics had a superior access to the 
“perceptual reality” of stimuli, without being influenced by their previous knowledge.

Principle 6: Perceptual Expertise Underlies Savant Syndrome

A remarkable aspect of “savant” performances is that domains of information (e.g., 
calendar) and types of cognitive operations performed on this material (e.g., list 
memory) are restricted, and highly similar among observers. We hypothesize that the 
development of savant ability requires five distinct components, including an encounter 
with a perceptually defined class of units, a brain-behavior cycle, expertise effects, 
implicit learning, and generalization to new material.

According to the autistic member of our team, M. Dawson, "We do what we 
can with what's around."

The encounter of a phenomenal regularity forms the "perceptual root" of the savant 
ability. This would be responsible for the apparent "material specificity" of autistic peaks 
of ability.

Principle 7: Savant Syndrome is an Autistic Model for Subtyping PDDs

The heterogeneity of the autistic phenotype at older ages would result from an 
overspecialization to a certain perceptual material inherent to the developmental course 
of autism. Autistic subtypes with and without a visuo-spatial peak, autism with or without
overt speech, and even the autism vs. Asperger distinction may be at least partially 
produced by differences in objects of expertise, in opportunity or lack thereof to enact 
perceptual specialization and expertise.

Principle 8: Enhanced Functioning of Primary Perceptual Brain Regions may 
Account for Autistic Perceptual Atypicalities

The organization of visual cortex suggests that the characteristics that differentiate 
autistic from non-autistic perception plausibly correspond to an overall superior 
functioning, involvement, and autonomy of posterior regions of the perceptual visual 
cortex. Locally oriented processing (Pr. 1), superior involvement of posterior regions in 
multiple tasks (Pr. 4), and enhanced autonomy toward higher-order influences (Pr. 5), 
would therefore correspond to a skewing of the “hierarchical axis" toward more posterior
regions.

CONCLUSION

Five years of research have strengthened the notion, stated in the original EPF model, 
that perception plays a different and superior role in autistic cognition. Recent studies in 
the visual and auditory modalities indicate a skewing of brain activation toward primary 
and early associative areas in autistics in most tasks involving higher-order or socially 
relevant information in non-autistics.

Therefore, it becomes increasingly difficult for "social-first" models to explain 
why most of the cognitive operations performed by autistics differ from their 
equivalent in non-autistics.

A new version of the EPF re-asserts, with a larger empirical basis, the principle of 
locally oriented and enhanced perceptual functioning. We propose to attribute both the 
choice of domain of special ability and some aspects of the phenotypic variability 
characterizing autistic subtypes to a brain-behavior cycle rooted in perceptual expertise 
effects.
