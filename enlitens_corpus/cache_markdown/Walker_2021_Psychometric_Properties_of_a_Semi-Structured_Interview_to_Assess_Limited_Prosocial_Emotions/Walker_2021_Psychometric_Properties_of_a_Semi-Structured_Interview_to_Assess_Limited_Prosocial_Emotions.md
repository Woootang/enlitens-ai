DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This research article details a study to validate the Michigan Limited Prosocial 
Emotion Addendum (M-LPE), a semi-structured interview method for assessing 
callous-unemotional (CU) traits, also known as the Limited Prosocial Emotions 
(LPE) specifier in DSM-5. The study found the M-LPE to have acceptable inter-rater 
reliability and demonstrated convergent, construct, and incremental validity when 
compared to other measures in a sample of at-risk, low-income, and primarily African 
American adolescents. The results support the M-LPE as a promising assessment tool 
for the LPE specifier in clinical research settings.

Abstract

Callous-unemotional (CU) traits have recently been added to the diagnostic criteria of
Conduct Disorder in the DSM-5 and of Conduct-dissocial and Oppositional Defiant 
Disorders in the ICD-11 as the Limited Prosocial Emotions specifier.

This change necessitates the assessment of these traits with validated 
measures in both research and clinical contexts.

The current study sought to validate a semi-structured diagnostic interview method, the 
Michigan Limited Prosocial Emotion Addendum (M-LPE) to the K-SADS-PL, of 
assessing CU traits based on a recently developed clinician rating system (CAPE 1.1) 
in a sample of at-risk youth. Results supported the inter-rater reliability of the M-LPE 
with moderate agreement and high reliability between raters. The M-LPE demonstrated 
convergent and incremental validity with CU traits and various measures of antisocial 
behavior. The results provide preliminary evidence for the use of a semi-structured 
interview assessment of CU traits in research contexts and build the foundation for 
further validation.

Research has consistently shown that conduct problems can vary greatly in their 
severity, stability, and causes in children and adolescents (Frick, 2012). Substantial 
research has further suggested that the presence of elevated levels of callous-
unemotional (CU) traits may be beneficial in explaining some of this heterogeneity. CU
traits have been conceptualized as a downward extension of the affective features of 
psychopathy or the affective components of conscience and are defined by four key 
components: absence of guilt or remorse, a callous-lack of empathy, a failure to put 
forth effort in important activities, and a constricted display of affect (Hare & Neumann, 
2008; Kimonis et al., 2015). Research has shown that youth with serious conduct 
problems who are elevated on these traits show a more severe and chronic pattern of 
antisocial behavior, and they show different cognitive, biological, environmental, and 
temperamental risk factors compared to other youth with conduct problems (Frick, Ray, 
Thornton, & Kahn, 2014). Further, youth with elevated CU traits start with more severe 
conduct problems and, while their behavior improves with treatment, often still show 
more severe behavior problems after treatment relative to other youth with serious 
conduct problems (Frick et al., 2014; Hawes, Price, & Dadds, 2014; Hyde, Waller, & 
Burt, 2014). As a result of this research, CU traits have recently been added to the 
major classification systems for diagnosing children with serious conduct problems. 
Specifically, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5th Edition 
(DSM– 5) now includes a specifier for Conduct Disorder (CD) for those high on CU 
traits called "with Limited Prosocial Emotions" (LPE) (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013) and the International Classification of Disease 11th edition (ICD-
11) includes this as a potential specifier for the diagnoses of Conduct-dissocial Disorder
and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) (World Health Organization, 2018).

This recent inclusion in the major classification systems for mental health diagnoses 
likely will lead to increases in the frequency with which these traits are assessed in a 
variety of research and clinical settings. To date, research has typically relied on multi-
informant rating scales to assess CU traits (Frick & Ray, 2015; Kotler & McMahon, 
2005). This assessment method is particularly beneficial because the measures are 
time-efficient, cost-effective, require little to no training to administer, and result in highly
reliable scores (Frick & Ray, 2015). One of the most commonly used measures to 
assess CU traits in research is the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU); 
Kimonis et al., 2008). The ICU is a 24-item behavior rating scale that includes forms for 
self-report, as well as parent- and teacher-report. The ICU was developed to a) provide 
a focused and comprehensive assessment of CU traits only (and not other dimensions 
of psychopathy), b) include a rating format that allows for sufficient variability in 
responses without including a central tendency point (i.e., items are anchored on a four-
point Likert scale from 0 (Not at all true) to 3 (Definitely true), and c) include equal 
numbers of items rated in the positive (i.e., higher rating indicating higher levels of CU 
traits) and negative (i.e., higher ratings indicating lower levels of CU traits) directions 
(Frick & Ray, 2015). To date, the ICU has been translated into over 25 different 
languages and has been used widely in research, with over 200 published studies in 
samples ranging in age from 3 years to young adulthood (Frick & Ray, 2015). Lastly, a 
meta-analysis from 115 samples (n=27,947) reported that the ICU total score generally 
showed adequate internal consistency (pooled a=0.83; positive correlations with 
aggression (pooled r=.41), delinquency (pooled r=.34), and externalizing behaviors 
(pooled r=.34); and negative correlations with measures of empathy (pooled r=-.42; 
Cardinale & Marsh, 2017).

Although questionnaires, like the ICU, have proven to be beneficial in the research 
context, there are still limitations in relying solely on rating scales for clinical decision 
making. First, rating scales do not allow the clinician to assess if the informant 
understood the questions and was answering them in the way that they were intended. 
Second, most of these measures do not include clinical cut-off scores to help determine 
if the levels of CU traits are impairing and/or non-normative (Kimonis, Fanti, & Singh, 
2014). Finally, with the exception of the ICU (Kimonis et al., 2015), most scales do not 
directly assess the symptoms used to define LPE in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria (see 
Kotler & McMahon, 2005).

To overcome these limitations, the Clinical Assessment of Prosocial Emotions, 
Version 1.1 (CAPE 1.1); Frick, 2013) was developed as a clinician rating system for 
use in a wide range of clinical settings. This measure uses semi-structured clinical 
interviews combined with professional judgment to assess the diagnostic criteria for the 
LPE specifier in youth ages 3 to 21 years old. The development of this assessment was
guided by research and closely tied to the way CU traits are measured by both the ICU 
and the DSM-5 criteria (Frick, 2013). The CAPE 1.1 includes semi-structured interviews
that are designed to be completed with both the child and another informant (e.g., 
primary caretaker) separately. These interviews consist of nine stem questions (e.g., 
“Does show his or her feelings openly to others?”), followed by requests for examples, 
and additional supplementary questions (e.g., “Is this how he/she is most of the time 
and with most people?”) that assess each of the four aforementioned diagnostic criteria 

of the Limited Prosocial Emotions specifier. Informants are encouraged to respond to 
the stem questions in “yes/no” fashion and then provide additional examples to aid 
making the final ratings. Based on the responses and examples provided, a highly 
trained clinician can then follow-up with any questions they feel are needed in order to 
rate the child on each symptom using a three-point scale from 0 (Not at all or mildly 
descriptive), 1 (moderately descriptive), or 2 (Highly descriptive). This final professional 
judgment on the presence of symptoms is based on information from multiple 
informants (at least the interviews with the child and another informant) and clinical 
information from other sources.

The CAPE 1.1 has been subjected to recent psychometric evaluation and shown 
promising reliability and validity of symptom counts and diagnostic cutoffs in 
international samples of high-risk (Centifanti et al., 2019) and detained youth (Molinuevo
et al., 2019). Hawes, Kimonis, Mendoza Diaz, Frick, and Dadds (2020) found evidence 
to support the reliability and validity of the CAPE 1.1 in a clinic-referred sample of 
children and adolescents (3 to 15 years) with conduct problems. CAPE 1.1 scores were 
associated with established correlates of CU traits (i.e., ODD and CD symptom 
severity, proactive aggression, and affective empathy). Also, youth with diagnoses of 
ODD and CD with or without the LPE specifier differed significantly on maternal ratings 
of affective empathy.

While the CAPE 1..1 is a promising clinical tool to assess CU traits as defined by the 
LPE specifier (Hawes, Kimonis, Diaz, Frick, & Dadds, 2019; Molinuevo et al., 2019), it 
requires extensive training in the assessment of psychopathology, extensive training in 
the CAPE specifically, and a fair amount of time in asking follow-up questions 
specifically about LPE. Such a clinician rating system may not be feasible in many 
clinical or research settings where the child needs to be assessed comprehensively for 
psychopathology by a semi-structured interview and without a clinician with extensive 
training. Thus, to bridge the gap between rating scales used in research and a clinician 
rating like the CAPE 1.1, the current study tested the Michigan Limited Prosocial 
Emotional Addendum (M-LPE), a semi-structured interview method for assessing the 
LPE based on the CAPE 1.1. The M-LPE was developed to be administered as part of 
the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia in Children-Present and 
Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL); Kaufman et al., 1997, 2016) embedded in the CD 
section with a similar structure. Thus the M-LPE uses the stem questions from the 
CAPE 1.1 (see https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/pfricklab/cape/items) and then, as in the 
broader K-SADS, offers additional CAPE questions as follow-up questions as needed, 
but excludes the request for examples and does not require that the clinician use all of 
the follow-up questions used by the CAPE 1.1. That is, the M-LPE adds content from 
the CAPE to screen for and assess LPE within the K-SADS-PL. Thus, the M-LPE can 
be used by trained researchers without extensive clinical experience and can be 
administered in a much shorter period of time as part of an overall diagnostic interview 
(10-15 minutes for M-LPE vs. 40-50 minutes for the CAPE 1.1).

Current Study

In this study, we assessed the inter-rater reliability and conducted initial tests of the 
validity of the M-LPE. First, we tested the inter-rater agreement between initial scores 
made from the original interviewer at a case conference (see below) and scores made 
by a second rater who watched only videotaped recordings of the interviews with 
parents and children and made ratings without any discussion. These second raters had
been trained on the CAPE 1.1. Second, we tested the convergent validity between the 
M-LPE and self- and parent-report versions of the ICU. This aim is a critical test of the 
validity of the M-LPE, given that much of the research supporting the validity of the 
construct of CU traits used the ICU or other rating scales (Frick et al., 2014). Third, we 
tested the validity of the M-LPE scores with measures of externalizing and internalizing 
symptoms, to determine if LPE scores would be positively correlated with measures of 
various types of externalizing behavior. Fourth, we tested the incremental validity of M-
LPE scores by testing whether the associations with measures of construct validity (i.e.,
externalizing and antisocial behaviors) would remain when controlling for ratings of CU 
traits on the ICU. This aim provided a critical test to determine if the use of a semi-
structured interview assessment provided useful information in the prediction of 
important criteria, over and above more time-efficient rating scales in a sample of mostly
African American participants, oversampled to include more adolescents at 
socioeconomic risk.

Method

Participants

Participants were drawn from a sample adolescents from Detroit, Toledo, and Chicago 
who participated in the Study of Adolescent Neural Development (SAND) at the 
University of Michigan (Goetschius et al., 2019; Hein et al., 2018). This SAND is a sub-
study of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS; Reichman, Teitler, 
Garfinkel, & McLanahan, 2001), a representative, longitudinal cohort of 4,898 children 
(52.4% boys) born in 20 major U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000 that was recruited 
from urban hospitals and oversampled for non-marital births (~3:1). This sample 
contains substantial representation of African American youth, as well as adolescents 
from families living in low-income contexts. Members of the SAND research team 
attempted to contact all of the families from the original Detroit and Toledo subsamples 
of FFCWS to take part in additional data collection at the University of Michigan as part 
of the SAND study when focal child was 15 years old. The team also contacted a small 
subset of families from the Chicago subsample to increase the total number of 
participants. In total, 237 of the 513 families that the team attempted to contact 
participated in the SAND data collection. The University of Michigan Medical School 
Institutional Review Board approved this study (UM IRBMED: HUM00074392). All 
adolescent participants provided written informed assent, and their primary caregivers 
provided written consent for both themselves and their adolescent children, after the 
study was explained and questions were answered.

There were no significant differences between the SAND sample and the original 
FFCWS sample from those cities on measures of maternal education, family income, 
and maternal marital status. The sample for the current analyses consisted of 144 
parent-teen dyads from the age 15 wave of the SAND study. Participants were included 

in the current study if the M-LPE was administered and videotaped for both the primary 
caregiver and child, and the audio was sufficient to allow for independent coding of 
responses. Though 237 participated in the SAND study, a subset of families (N=52) did 
not have full high-quality videotapes of the interviews for both parent and child because 
the video was cut off prior to the administration of the M-LPE items. Additionally, 32 
videos did not have codeable responses for both parent and child report of each 
symptom. Of the 144 adolescents who were included in the present analyses, 51.4% 
were female, 76.4% were Black/African American, 16% were White/European-
American, and 42% of families reported annual income below $25,000. The primary 
caregivers reporting on the teens' symptoms were biological mothers (89.6%), biological
fathers (4.9%), adoptive mothers (2.1%), and other relatives (3.5%). The sample used 
in the current analyses were not significantly different from the full SAND sample on 
maternal education and marital status. The sample in the current analyses did have 
marginally significantly lower scores on CBCL Rule Breaking (M=1.14) at age 15 than 
those not included (M=1.69); t(232)=1.97, p=.05. The samples also significantly differed 
on race (X²(5,N=237)=16.39, p<.01), with the sample included in the current analyses 
having a smaller proportion of minorities (84%) and higher proportion of 
White/European-American (15.9%) than the proportion of minorities (92.4%) and White/ 
European-Americans (7.5%) not included.

Procedure

IRB approval for the study was obtained by all research sites where the data was 
collected and analyzed. The M-LPE was scored and interviews were recorded at time of
data collection. Combined total lifetime symptom count (i.e., both past and present 
clinical threshold symptoms) of DSM-5 Limited Prosocial Emotions (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013) based on clinician-ratings assessed via a modified 
version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia 
(KSADS); Kaufman et al., 1997). A trained clinical interviewer (e.g., psychology doctoral
student, post-baccalaureate staff) administered the semi-structured interview to the 
target child and primary caregiver each individually. Assessors were trained by two 
licensed clinical psychologists with 25+ years of combined experience with the K-SADS 
but with no experience with the CAPE (authors LWH, NLD). Training for the K-SADS 
broadly included practice interviews and live supervision of interviews with families. The 
interviewer arrived at initial symptom ratings, symptom counts, and DSM-5 diagnoses 
for each informant, which were then reviewed in case conferences with two licensed 
clinical psychologists and the assessment team to determine the best report score for 
the aforementioned ratings. Training for the M-LPE included reading the CAPE 1.1 
manual, but nothing additional. Symptoms are rated on a 3-point scale ( 0= not present; 
1= present at subclinical; 2= present at clinical threshold). The secondary coders (e.g. 
graduate students, post-doctoral scholar) were from a different university who did not 
participate in the initial interviews but had more extensive experience with the CAPE 
1.1. These coders reviewed the recorded videos of the parent interview and child 
interview and coded symptoms on a similar 3-point scale based on the DSM-5 LPE 
criteria. As a result, these reliability codes did not involve a clinical case conference. 
The three point scores were used to create the dichotomous CU diagnosis variable, 
which was coded as "present" if at least two symptoms were coded as present, and “not

present" if only one or no symptoms were coded as present, consistent with the DSM-5 
criteria for the LPE specifier (American Psychological Association, 2013).

Measures

Callous-Unemotional Traits.—CU traits were assessed with the Inventory of 
Callous Unemotional Traits (ICU); Kimonis et al., 2008). As described above, the ICU 
is a 24-item rating scale that assesses a wide range of indicators of CU traits and 
contains equal numbers of items worded in the positive (meaning higher levels of CU 
traits; e.g., "I do not feel remorseful when I do something wrong ') and negative 
(meaning lower levels of CU traits; e.g., "I am concerned about the feelings of others ') 
directions. To create a total score, the negatively-worded items are recoded so that 
higher scores indicate higher levels of CU traits. The current analyses also utilized a 
resolved ICU total score, created by taking the higher score between the parent- and 
child-reports for each symptom and summing them. As noted above, the total ICU score
has been consistently associated with antisocial behavior (positively) and empathy 
(negatively) across a range of adolescent samples (Cardinale & Marsh, 2017). Internal 
consistency in this sample was acceptable for both parent-report (a= .78), self-report 
(a=.78), and the resolved score (a=.80).

Conduct Problems.—Conduct problems were measured using behavior rating scales 
and a semi-structured clinical interview. Parent- and child-reported behavior ratings of 
conduct problems were assessed using the Youth Self Report (YSR) and Child 
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scales of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based 
Assessment measures (Achenbach, 2009). A Rule Breaking (RB) syndrome scale was 
created by summing 12 items from each measure generally covert conduct problems 
(e.g., “Steals outside of the home”, “Runs away from home"). The Aggressive Behavior 
(AGG) syndrome scale consists of 20 items that generally measure more overt conduct 
problems and aggression (i.e., “Destroys things belonging to his/her family or others”, 
“Physically attacks people”, “Threatens people”). For both scales, participants rated 
each item on a 3-point Likert scale from 0 (Not true) to 2 (Very true or often true), which 
were summed to create a total score. Internal consistency for the RB scale was 
acceptable for both the CBCL (a=.69) and the YSR (a=.68). Internal consistency was 
strong for both the CBCL AGG scale (a=.86) and the YSR AGG scale (a=.85). Previous 
studies have demonstrated external validity of the Rule Breaking and Aggressive 
Behavior scales through strong correlations with ODD and CD and significant predictive 
validity of overt and covert CD dimensions measured by semi-structured interviews 
(Gomez, Vance, & Gomez, 2014; Tackett, Kreuger, Sawyer, & Graetz, 2003). Moderate 
associations have also been found between both scales and CU traits in both boys 
(RB=.47; AGG=.42) and girls (RB=.43; AGG=.44; Charles, Acheson, Mathias, Furr, & 
Dougherty, 2012).

The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL) was 
used as a measure of DSM-5 symptoms of conduct problems (Kaufman et al., 1997). 
The K-SADS-PL is a semi-structured interview that assesses the diagnostic criteria of 
the major DSM-IV disorders that are displayed by children and adolescents. Since there
was no change in the actual symptoms of CD and ODD between the 4th and 5th 

editions of the DSM, the method of scoring did not need to change. The youth and their 
parent independently reported on the youth's symptoms of CD and ODD. For each 
informant rating of the symptom, interviewers coded the symptoms as 0 (Not present), 1
(Sub-clinical), or 2 (Present). The parent and youth's ratings on each symptom were 
used to create a summary “best” rating by clinical judgement, which was the consensus 
decision from the research team based on all the information presented, as described 
above for the assessment of the LPE specifier. We created a symptom count variable 
for all above threshold present endorsements for each symptom of CD and ODD. Of the
current sample, only 1.4% (N=2) and 4.2% (N=6) met criteria for past and present CD 
and ODD, respectively.

Aggression.—Aggression was assessed with the self-report Reactive-Proactive 
Aggression Questionnaire (RPQ); Raine et al., 2006). Participants rated the 
frequency of both their reactive and proactive forms of verbal and physical aggression 
using a 3-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 2 (Often). The 26 items (13 reactive and 
13 proactive) were summed to create a total aggression score. Internal consistency for 
this scale was strong (a =.85). Previous research shows that proactive and reactive 
aggression as measured by the RPQ are significantly associated with CU traits, 
psychopathy, delinquency, and impulsivity in detained and community samples of 
adolescents and young adults (Raine et al., 2006; Fanti, Frick, & Georgiou, 2009; 
Feilhauer, Cima, & Arntz, 2012).

Delinquency.—Participant's frequency of antisocial behaviors was measured with the 
Self-Report of Delinquency (SRD); Elliot & Ageton, 1984). Participants self-reported 
how often they engaged in each of the 62 items in the past year from 0 (Never) to 2 
(More often). Total sum scores were used in the current analyses such that higher 
scores indicated more engagement in delinquent behavior. Internal consistency for the 
SRD in this sample was strong (a=.85). Previous studies have shown significant 
correlations between self-reported delinquency and official records of delinquent 
involvement and arrests (Huizinga & Elliott, 1986). The positive relationship between 
self-reported CU traits and this measure of delinquency is well-established (Ansel, 
Barry, Gillen, & Herrington, 2014; Frick, Stickle, Dandreaux, Farrell, & Kimonis, 2005).

Analytic Plan

The inter-rater reliability of the M-LPE was assessed in three ways. First, the absolute 
level of agreement between the interviewer and coders on the presence or absence of 
each symptom and a diagnosis of LPE was estimated. Second, the phi coefficient was 
used to determine the statistical significance and effect size of the level of association 
between the two raters' scores, with scores below 0.3 considered weak, 0.3 to 0.5 
moderate, and 0.5 and above strong (McHugh, 2018). Third, the level of agreement 
between raters for the total symptom counts was assessed through the intraclass 
correlation, which not only considers the level of association (i.e., correspondence 
between the relative level between the two raters), but the correspondence in the 
absolute valuate of the ratings.

To test the convergent validity of the M-LPE, total symptom counts from the M-LPE 
were correlated with the ICU. Correlations were also used to determine construct 

validity of the M-LPE symptom counts, by testing their correlations with measures of 
various types of externalizing behaviors: CD and ODD symptoms, delinquency, and 
aggression. Finally, simultaneous multiple regressions were run to test the incremental 
association of the M-LPE symptom count with externalizing behaviors, delinquency, and
aggression after controlling for ICU scores. The M-LPE symptom counts and ICU 
scores were used as independent variables, with the measures of externalizing 
behaviors, delinquency, and aggression as the dependent measures.

Results

Reliability

The first aim of the current study was to examine the inter-rater agreement between the 
interviewers' initial ratings and the coders' ratings on symptoms of CU traits as 
measured by the M-LPE. Of note, the LPE diagnosis had a very low base rate in this 
sample and was rated as present 3.5% (N=5) of the time by interviewer and 1.4% (N=2 
by coder regardless of whether they met criteria for a CD diagnosis. There was 98% 
agreement between interviewer and coders' ratings on the presence of a Limited 
Prosocial Emotions diagnosis and this high level of agreement is reflected by a strong 
phi coefficient (phi= .63, p<.001). However, given the low base rate of the diagnosis, the
reliability of the overall diagnosis should be interpreted with caution and more attention 
should be given to the reliability of the symptom counts, which did show more variability.
Specifically, a high degree of reliability was also found between the interviewer and 
coder ratings of total symptom counts, with the average measure ICC at .75 (p<.001 
with a 95% confidence interval from .65 to .82. For the individual symptoms, the 
prevalence rates for the interviewer ranged from 0.7% for the parent reported “lack of 
empathy” symptom to 6.9% for the self-reported “shallow affect" symptom. Prevalence 
rates for the coder ranged from 0% for parent reported “shallow affect" to 3.5% for self-
reported “lack of remorse”. The level of agreement for individual symptoms ranged from 
93% for the self-reported "shallow affect" symptom to 99% for both the parent reported 
"lack of remorse" and best report "lack of empathy" symptom, with phi coefficients 
ranging from .27 to .81 for these symptoms (all ps<.01).

Validity

The second aim was to test the convergent validity of the M-LPE with the ICU. The 
zero-order correlations between the M-LPE symptom counts and self-reported (r=.29,p 
< .01), parent-reported (r=.27,p<.01), and resolved (r= .36, p<.01) ICU scores are 
provided in Table 1. These correlations show a moderate level of convergence across 
the two methods for assessing CU traits.

Table 1 also displays the results addressing the third aim, which was to test the 
construct validity of the M-LPE scores by their associations with various measures of 
externalizing behaviors. As expected, M-LPE symptom count was significantly positively
associated with self-reported delinquency (r= .18, p<.05, RPQ aggression ( r=.37 
p< .01), parent-reported rule breaking (r=.31, p<.01), parent-reported aggression (r=.18,
p< .05), ODD symptoms (r=.28, p<.01, and CD symptoms ( r=.40 p< .01). Contrary to 
expectations, the M-LPE symptom count was not related to youth-reported rule 

breaking or aggression. Table 1 also reveals that the M-LPE and ICU scores show 
different correlations with measures of antisocial behavior. Comparisons of the 
correlates using Fisher's r-to-z transformation for dependent correlations (Lee & 
Preacher, 2003) showed that M-LPE and ICU Resolved scores had significantly 
different correlations with YSR Rule Breaking (z =2.45; p<.05, YSR Aggression (z=2.40;
p<.05, CBCL Aggression (z=2.48, p< .05), with the ICU showing stronger associations. 
The ICU Child and M-LPE differed in their relationship with YSR Rule Breaking (z=2.12,
p<.05, YSR Aggression (z=2.50; p<.05), K-SADS-PL CD symptoms (z=2.05, p<.05), 
and delinquency (z=2.36 p< .05), again with the ICU showing stronger associations. 
Finally, the M-LPE showed stronger associations with the K-SADS-PL CD symptoms 
than the ICU Child (z=2.05, p<.05 and Parent (z=2.53, p<.05 report.

Finally, the fourth aim of the current study was to test the incremental validity of the M-
LPE symptom count, relative to the more time efficient ratings from the ICU. The results
of these analyses are provided in Table 2 and should be interpreted in light of the zero-
order correlations presented in Table 1. In the first two rows of the table, the results of 
the multiple regression analyses testing the incremental association of the M-LPE 
symptom count controlling for parent-reported ICU are provided. The M-LPE symptom 
count accounted for a significant incremental portion of the variance in K-SADS-PL 
ODD symptoms (b*= .22, p<.01) and K-SADS-PL CD symptoms (b*=.38, p<.001). The 
M-LPE symptom count also accounted for a significant incremental variance in youth-
reported aggression (b* =33, p<.01 over and above parent-reported CU traits. In the 
second section of Table 2, the results of the multiple regression analyses testing the 
incremental contribution of the M-LPE symptom count controlling for self-reported CU 
traits are provided. When entered in the model with self-reported CU traits, M-LPE 
symptoms again accounted for incremental variance in parent-reported rule breaking 
behavior (b*=.30, p<.001), K-SADS-PL ODD (b*=.25, p<.01), and CD (b*=.39, p<.001) 
symptoms, and self-reported aggression (b*=.30,p<.01). When entered into the model 
with a resolved ICU total score, M-LPE symptoms accounted for incremental variance in
parent-reported rule breaking (b*=.23, p< .01), K-SADS-PL CD symptoms (b*=.36, 
p<.001), and aggression (b*=.27, p<.05).

Discussion

In the current study, we provided initial data on the reliability and validity (i.e., 
convergent, construct, and incremental) of a structured interview method, the M-LPE, 
for assessing the LPE specifier, which was recently added to the diagnosis of Conduct 
Disorder in the DSM-5 and Conduct-dissocial Disorder or Oppositional Defiant 
Disorder in the ICD-11. The M-LPE was developed to provide a method for assessing 
the symptoms of LPE embedded within the K-SADS in a way that provides more 
information than self or informant-based rating scales, but that does not require the 
same level of training, nor administration time, as the full CAPE. Further, the reliability 
coder ratings were purely based on the answers provided by the participants without 
further discussion of symptom ratings by coders expert in the CAPE (as opposed to the 
original codes which were made after discussion in a clinical case conference but with 
non-CAPE experts). The high reliability between these codes suggests that one would 
obtain fairly consistent information without the more intensive clinical case conference. 

Thus, the M-LPE format is well suited for use in many clinical and research settings, 
particularly as embedded within the K-SADS and to be used by clinicians or 
researchers trained and experienced in the use of the K-SADS-PL.

Overall, our findings demonstrated an acceptable degree of inter-rater reliability 
between the initial ratings made by the interviewer and ratings from re-coded videos of 
the M-LPE in this sample of mostly African American, and low-income adolescents. 
These results suggest the information gained from the M-LPE questions lead to 
responses that can be interpreted consistently across raters, even without the more 
extended request for examples and clinician determined follow-up questions used by 
the CAPE 1.1. This level of reliability is consistent with the level of reliability found for 
the assessment of other forms of psychopathology using the K-SADS-PL in various 
samples of adolescents (Ambrosini, 2000; Kaufman et al., 1997; de la Peña et al., 2018;
Lauth, Magnusson, Ferrari, & Petursson, 2008). Thus, the symptoms of the LPE 
specifier, which focuses on the child's emotional and interpersonal style, can be 
assessed as reliably as overt behaviors, when assessed through a structured interview 
format (Frick & Nigg, 2012).

Our results also showed the symptom count from the M-LPE is modestly correlated with
parent- and self-reported ratings on the ICU, one of the most common ways that CU 
traits have been assessed in research to date (Frick & Ray, 2015). Of note, these 
validity coefficients were statistically significant, but modest in size (e.g., r=20 and .27, 
for child- and parent-report, respectively). However, these are comparable to the low to 
moderate associations between the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 
(DISC; Costello, Edelbrock, & Dulcan, 1984) and parent- (r=.29-.31) and teacher- 
(r= .14 - .28) ratings of conduct problems (Hodges, 1993). Thus, this low level of 
agreement may reflect typical levels of association when assessing constructs using 
different informants and methods (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987; De Los 
Reyes & Kazdin, 2005). Alternatively, this may reflect differences between information 
gathered from interviews, during which the interviewer can ensure that the informant is 
understanding the question appropriately and are able to weigh the report of various 
informants when making decisions on whether or not a symptom is present. This is 
supported by the fact that the M-LPE scores were more highly correlated with conduct 
problems assessed by the semi-structured interview (K-SADS), whereas ICU was more
highly correlated with rating scale measures (YSR) of antisocial behavior.

Convergent validity was established through positive associations between M-LPE 
symptom counts and measures of delinquency, CD symptoms, and aggression. 
Specifically, the M-LPE was consistently associated with these measures of more 
severe types of externalizing behaviors at a level consistent with what has been 
reported in past research. Specifically, Frick et al. (2014) reviewed 118 studies (70 
cross-sectional and 48 longitudinal) and reported that the average correlation between 
CU traits and measures of externalizing behaviors was .33.

Of note, the M-LPE explained incremental variance in parent-reported CD 
and ODD symptoms, parent-reported rule-breaking, and child-reported 

aggression (but not child-reported delinquency), even after controlling for 
ICU scores.

This finding of the incremental utility of the M-LPE is particularly important for 
suggesting that the information gathered from semi-structured interviews adds to the 
variance explained in certain clinically important outcomes, relative to the more time-
efficient behavior ratings. Notably, our findings revealed that the resolved ICU score 
sometimes performed worse than when using scores from a single rater. This may 
suggest that if one informant is a better reporter than the other, combining their reports 
mathematically (rather than via clinician-led interview) may decrease the validity of the 
better reporter.

These results need to be considered within the context of several limitations. Of most 
importance, the use of a non-referred sample led to a very small number of participants 
meeting the diagnostic criteria for ODD (past diagnosis: n=8,7.1%, current diagnosis: 
n=7,4.9%), CD (past diagnosis: n=9,6.3%, current diagnosis: n=2,1.4%), and the LPE 
specifier (past diagnosis: n=5,3.5%, current diagnosis: n=5,3.5%). This finding is 
consistent with past studies finding that the rate of children and adolescents meeting the
threshold for the LPE specifier is below 5% in community samples (Kahn, Frick, 
Youngstrom, Findling, & Youngstrom, 2012; McMahon et al., 2010; Pardini et al., 2012; 
Seijas et al., 2018). However, it meant that we could not restrict our analyses to only 
those who met the LPE specifier and who also met criteria for CD, as specified in the 
DSM-5 criteria. Further, it meant that our tests had to largely focus on the validity of the 
symptom counts for the LPE specifier, rather than on the very low base rate diagnosis. 
Thus, the reliability and validity of the M-LPE will need to be tested in much larger 
samples with higher rates of CD (e.g., clinic-referred and forensic samples), which 
would lead to higher base rates of the specifier with and without CD. In addition, the 
method for assessing the inter-rater reliability of the M-LPE was to have coders make 
ratings from videotapes of the original interview, rather than conducting independent 
interviews. This may have led to inflated reliability estimates, although the structured 
format used by the interviewers led to little variability in how the questions were asked 
on the M-LPE. Further, the tests of the construct validity of the M-LPE was limited to its 
correlations with externalizing behaviors. As noted by Frick et al. (2014), the construct 
of CU traits has shown theoretically and clinically important correlations with other 
measures, such as being associated with reduced sensitivity to fear and distress in 
others, with less sensitivity to punishment cues under certain conditions, and with lower 
levels of fear, as well as moderating the effectiveness of certain treatments for serious 
conduct problems. Thus, more comprehensive tests of the M-LPE's construct validity 
are needed to fully evaluate its ability to assess the construct of CU traits in ways 
similar to other measures that have been used in research. Finally, given that the study 
utilized an adolescent sample that represents mostly non-marital births in large 
Midwestern cities and was mostly African American and mostly low income, the results 
may not generalize to other populations.

Conclusion

Within the context of these limitations, the results of this study provide initial promising 
psychometric evidence for the use of a semi-structured interview for the assessment of 
the LPE specifier in clinical research. This method provides an alternative to using 
established behavior rating scales in that it allows for interviewers to ensure that 
questions are being understood by the informant, but it does not require the same time 
requirement and level of training as the CAPE 1.1, which requires clinician ratings.

Given the recent inclusion of the LPE specifier in the major classification 
systems for childhood and adolescent disorders, there is a great need for 
multiple methods for assessing the symptoms of the specifier that vary in 
their time and training requirements in order to meet the needs of various 
assessment contexts. The M-LPE provides a promising approach for use in 
many clinical research settings.
