DOCUMENT SUMMARY This systematic review synthesizes the scientific literature on the 
"biological embedding" of child maltreatment, focusing on two key biomarkers in children and 
youth: telomere length and DNA methylation. The review confirms that child maltreatment is 
associated with measurable changes in both biomarkers, consistent with accelerated cellular 
aging and altered gene expression. Crucially, it also highlights key resilience factors, such as 
responsive parenting and higher socioeconomic status, that can buffer against these negative 
biological changes, providing important targets for intervention.

Biological Embedding of Child 
Maltreatment: A Systematic Review of 
Biomarkers and Resilience in Children and
Youth

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This systematic review provides a comprehensive, one-stop summary of the core scientific 
evidence that early life trauma gets "under the skin" and becomes biologically embedded. It is 
essential to our work because it moves beyond theory and synthesizes the empirical findings on
two of the most critical biomarkers we discuss: DNA methylation and telomere length.

Most importantly, the review's focus on resilience provides powerful validation for our clinical 
approach. The finding that responsive parenting can buffer the biological harm of 
maltreatment is a cornerstone piece of evidence for our family-systems and strengths-based 
model. It gives a scientific basis to our work with parents, showing that creating supportive 
environments is not just psychologically beneficial but can protect children at a cellular level.

Critical Findings for Our Work

This review synthesized 26 articles from 16 unique studies focused on children and adolescents
(<18 years old) with a history of child maltreatment (CM).

● Overall Conclusion: Despite some variability in the literature, the evidence supports 
that child maltreatment is associated with differential changes in both telomere length 
(TL) and DNA methylation (DNAm).

● Telomere Length (TL) Findings: TL is a marker of cellular aging, and accelerated 
shortening indicates a person is biologically older than their chronological age.

○ Experiences of severe neglect, such as institutional care, are associated with 

shorter telomeres.

○ Child physical abuse was significantly associated with TL shortening.
○ Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) was also linked to shorter telomeres.
○ Contradictory Finding: One study found longer telomeres in children with 
recent, severe CM, which may be due to an acute stress response that 
temporarily upregulates telomerase, an enzyme that lengthens telomeres .

● DNA Methylation (DNAm) Findings: DNAm is an epigenetic process that regulates 

gene expression and can be altered by experiences like chronic stress.

○ Widespread Effects: CM is associated with differential methylation at thousands
of specific CpG sites, often in genes related to immune function, disease risk, 
and depression.

○ Key Candidate Genes: Two stress-related genes are consistently implicated:

■ The glucocorticoid receptor gene (

NR3C1) is frequently found to be hypermethylated (expression is 
suppressed) in maltreated children.

■ The

 FKBP5 gene is often hypomethylated (expression is increased).

○ Epigenetic Clocks: Studies using epigenetic clocks (Horvath and Hannum 

models) found that exposure to physical or sexual abuse was associated with 
accelerated epigenetic aging, an effect that may be stronger in girls.

Key Resilience Factors Identified

The review uses Bronfenbrenner's socioecological model to frame factors that can protect 
against the biological embedding of trauma.

● Microsystem (Family & Parenting): This level involves direct interactions.

○ Responsive parenting was found to significantly moderate (buffer) the 

association between early-life stress and telomere shortening.

○ Evidence-based interventions designed to improve parent-child relationships 

have been shown to alter DNAm patterns in children who have been maltreated, 
suggesting the biological effects are not necessarily permanent.
● Exosystem (Community & Socioeconomic Status): This level involves indirect 

environmental influences.

○ Children of married mothers with more education and from higher SES 

backgrounds showed less epigenetic aging.

○ Higher maternal education also had a buffering effect on telomere length in 

maltreated boys.

● Child-Level Factors:

○ Sex differences in biological response to trauma are common, with some effects 
being stronger in boys and others in girls, suggesting different pathways of 
vulnerability and resilience.

Methodological Considerations We Can Learn From

● The "Threat vs. Deprivation" Model: The review cites prior work by Colich et al. 

cite_start which found that experiences of "threat" (e.g., physical/sexual abuse) were 
more consistently associated with accelerated biological aging than experiences of 
"deprivation" (e.g., neglect).

● Heterogeneity of Findings: The authors stress that findings across the literature are 
variable. This is largely due to a lack of standardized methods, including different 
definitions of child maltreatment, different measurement tools, and different timings of 
assessment, making direct comparisons difficult.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the core concept of biological embedding: "...biological changes observed in some 

maltreated individuals may represent relevant mediators in the association... This is the 
idea that adverse experiences may exert an effect on biology".

● On the importance of resilience: "Deeper understanding of resilience and the process of 
biological embedding may help identify factors that could help break cycles of CM, 
mitigate risk, and maximize outcomes for maltreated children".

● On the power of parenting: "Asok et al (2013) found significant moderating effects of 

responsive parenting on telomere shortening".

● On the potential for intervention: "Participants randomized to the intervention [to improve
parent-child relationships] showed differential methylation in whole-genome DNAm 
compared to the control group postintervention".

Clinical Implications

● The findings provide a clear biological rationale for why early and robust intervention for 

child maltreatment is a critical public health priority.

● The review strongly supports interventions that focus on strengthening the parent-child 
relationship and promoting responsive parenting. These approaches are not only 
psychologically beneficial but may have the power to buffer or even reverse the negative
biological embedding of childhood trauma.

● While biomarkers like DNAm and telomere length are not yet ready for individual clinical 
diagnostics, they are powerful research tools that help elucidate the pathways from 
experience to outcome and can help identify novel targets for future interventions.
