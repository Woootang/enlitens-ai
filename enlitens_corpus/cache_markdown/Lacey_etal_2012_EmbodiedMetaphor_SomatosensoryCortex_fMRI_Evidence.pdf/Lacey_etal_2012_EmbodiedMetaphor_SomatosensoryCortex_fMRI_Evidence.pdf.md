DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This fMRI study provides powerful, direct evidence for the theory of embodied cognition, 
empirically validating the framework presented by Gallese & Lakoff. Researchers found that 
when people comprehend sentences with textural metaphors (e.g., "He had a rough day"), the 
texture-selective region of their somatosensory cortex—the same part of the brain used for the 
physical sense of touch—becomes active. This finding demonstrates that even abstract, 
metaphorical language is grounded in our sensory experience, directly challenging the 
traditional view that cognition is an amodal, abstract process and providing a neurological basis 
for Enlitens' focus on lived, sensory-motor experience as the foundation of understanding.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"Some accounts of cognition propose that knowledge is represented in abstract codes, distinct 
from the sensory modalities through which the knowledge was acquired, and that cognitive 
processes involve computations on these amodal representations (Fodor, 1975; Pylyshyn, 
2007). Theories of grounded cognition reject this notion, proposing instead that knowledge is 
represented in modal systems derived from perception and that cognition depends on 
perceptual simulations (Barsalou, 2008)."

"Conceptual metaphor theory is one approach to grounded cognition which suggests that 
knowledge is structured by metaphorical mappings from sensory experience (Lakoff & Johnson,
2003)."

"These two approaches to metaphor comprehension make very different predictions about the 
neural basis of metaphor processing. If lexicalized metaphors do not require access to the 
corresponding concrete concept, then activity should be largely limited to classical language 

areas, whereas conceptual metaphor theory predicts activity in sensory areas involved in 
processing the domain from which the metaphor is derived."

"Our findings provide the first clear evidence for activity in functionally localized, domain-specific
sensory cortical areas during processing of metaphors."

"...it appears that metaphor processing selectively activated sensory areas in the modality from 
which the metaphors primarily derived their meaning."

"The present findings, together with numerous behavioral studies... are consistent with the 
conceptual metaphor theory of grounded cognition (Lakoff & Johnson, 2003), but not with 
accounts of lexicalized metaphors in which these are simply learned linguistic conventions that 
do not require access to root concepts (Keysar & Bly, 1999; Keysar et al., 2000)."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Primary Finding: Processing sentences with textural metaphors activated the texture-
selective somatosensory cortex in the parietal operculum when compared to literal 
sentences with the same meaning.

● Functional Localization: The specific brain regions activated by the metaphors were 
confirmed to be within the same areas that were independently identified as being 
selective for the physical, haptic perception of texture in the same participants. This 
provides a direct link between abstract language and physical sensation.

● Modality Specificity: The activation was specific to the somatosensory (touch) cortex. 

There was no metaphor-specific activity in visually-selective texture regions. The authors
suggest this is because texture is particularly salient to touch, and the metaphors used 
(e.g., 'a rough day', 'a slimy person') primarily derive their negative meaning from the 
unpleasantness of the physical sensation of touch.

● No Effect in Language Areas: There was no differential activation in classical language
areas between the metaphorical and literal sentences, suggesting that general linguistic 
processing was equivalent for both and that the key difference lay in the recruitment of 
the sensory cortex.

● Robustness of Finding: Despite a small sample size, the effect sizes for the activation 

in the parietal opercular regions were medium-to-large (Cohen's d ranged from 0.65 to 
1.63) with very narrow confidence intervals, confirming the results are robust.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

Participants & Materials

● Participants: Seven right-handed, native American English speakers participated. 

Crucially, these same individuals had previously participated in a separate fMRI study 
that functionally localized their specific brain regions for perceiving physical texture 
through touch and vision, though they were unaware of the connection between the 
studies.

● Stimuli: The study used 54 sentences containing conventional texture metaphors (e.g., 
"She had a rough day"). Each metaphoric sentence was paired with a literal control 

sentence that had an equivalent meaning (e.g., "She had a bad day") but did not use a 
textural word. The sentence pairs were matched for average number of syllables and 
acoustic properties (duration, pitch, amplitude, speech rate).

fMRI Task and Analysis

● Task: In a rapid event-related fMRI design, participants listened to the sentences 

through headphones and were instructed to press a button as soon as they understood 
the sentence's meaning.

● Analysis: The primary analysis was a direct contrast of the BOLD signal between the 

metaphorical sentence condition and the literal sentence condition.

● Functional Localizer: The key methodological strength was the use of an independent 
functional localizer. The activation map from the metaphor task was overlaid onto the 
activation maps from a previous texture perception task with the same subjects. This 
allowed the researchers to definitively confirm that the brain area activated by
 understanding a textural metaphor was the same area activated by physically feeling 
texture.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Grounded Cognition

This paper operates within the broader theoretical framework of Grounded Cognition, which 
posits that knowledge is not stored in abstract, amodal codes but is "grounded" in the brain's 
sensory and motor systems. Cognition is thought to rely on "perceptual simulations"—the 
reactivation of the same neural states that were present during the original perception or action. 
This study serves as a direct test of this framework.

Conceptual Metaphor Theory

This is the specific theory being tested. A branch of grounded cognition, it suggests that abstract
concepts are understood via metaphorical mappings from more concrete, sensory-motor 
domains of experience. For example, abstract difficulties are understood through the physical 
experience of texture (a "rough day"). The theory predicts that understanding such a metaphor 
should reactivate the brain regions associated with the source domain (in this case, the 
somatosensory cortex for touch/texture). The study's results are presented as strong support for
this theory.

Amodal (Lexicalized) Metaphor Theory (Critiqued)

The paper contrasts conceptual metaphor theory with the amodal view, which argues that 
conventional metaphors are simply lexicalized idioms with stored, abstract meanings. On this 
account, hearing "rough day" does not require accessing the sensory concept of "roughness" 
because we have simply learned a second, abstract definition for "rough" that means 
"unpleasant". This theory would predict that metaphor processing should occur in classical 
language areas, not sensory areas. The findings of this study directly contradict the predictions 
of this amodal theory.
