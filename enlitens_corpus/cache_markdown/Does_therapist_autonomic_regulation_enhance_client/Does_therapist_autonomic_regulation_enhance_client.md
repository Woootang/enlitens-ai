Does therapist autonomic regulation enhance client physiological synchrony?

Therapist Autonomic Regulation and Client Physiological Synchrony

Current research indicates that therapist autonomic regulation can enhance client physiological synchrony, but

the effect is nuanced and context-dependent.

Evidence for Enhanced Synchrony

•

Therapist-led synchrony: Studies show that when a therapist’s autonomic state (e.g., arousal, as measured by

electrodermal activity or heart rate variability) is stable and regulated, clients are more likely to synchronize their

physiological responses with the therapist. This therapist-led synchrony is associated with more positive client

emotions, such as increased contentment and reduced anxiety and depression during therapy sessions (Prinz et

al., 2021).

•

•

Moment-to-moment dynamics: Synchrony is not static; it fluctuates throughout sessions. Greater synchrony—

both in-phase (matching) and antiphase (complementary)—is observed during productive and positive

emotional experiences, which are often facilitated by the therapist’s attuned presence and regulation (Bar-Kalifa

et al., 2023).

Therapeutic alliance: Higher physiological synchrony, especially when therapist regulation leads, is linked to

stronger therapeutic bonds and more favorable session evaluations by clients (Bar-Kalifa et al., 2023; Bar-Kalifa
et al., 2019; Prinz et al., 2021).

Mechanisms and Moderators

•

•

Interpersonal regulation: Therapists who are responsive and attuned to clients’ arousal can help regulate

clients’ autonomic states, fostering synchrony and emotional safety (Goren et al., 2024).

Context matters: The degree of synchrony and its benefits depend on the emotional context, the therapeutic

technique used, and the specific client-therapist dyad (Bar-Kalifa et al., 2023; Bar-Kalifa et al., 2019; Prinz et al.,

2021).

Conclusion

Therapist autonomic regulation does enhance client physiological synchrony, particularly when the therapist’s

regulated state leads the interaction. This synchrony supports positive emotional experiences and a stronger

therapeutic alliance, though effects vary with context and individual dyads.
