The Neuroscientific Basis for Why Emotionally Charged Events Are
Remembered More Vividly

1. Introduction

Emotionally charged events are often remembered with greater vividness and persistence than neutral

experiences. Neuroscientific research has revealed that this phenomenon is rooted in the interplay between the

amygdala, hippocampus, and broader neuromodulatory systems, which together enhance the encoding,

consolidation, and retrieval of emotional memories (Krenz et al., 2025; McGaugh, 2018; McGaugh, 2015; Qasim et

al., 2021; Roesler et al., 2021; LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; Paré & Headley, 2023; Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015; Todd et al.,

2012; Hamann, 2001; McGaugh, 2004; Zhang et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2007; Sharot et al., 2004; Dolcos et al., 2004;

Murty et al., 2010). Emotional arousal triggers the release of stress hormones and neuromodulators (notably

norepinephrine and glucocorticoids), which activate the amygdala. The amygdala, in turn, modulates memory-

related processes in the hippocampus and neocortex, leading to more robust and detailed memory traces. This

review synthesizes evidence from neuroimaging, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and behavioral studies to

explain the neural mechanisms underlying the vividness of emotional memories.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The search strategy involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8 thematic

clusters, focusing on the neural basis of emotional memory vividness, amygdala-hippocampal interactions,

neuromodulation, sleep, and clinical implications. In total, 1,041 papers were identified, 672 were screened, 588

were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Amygdala-Hippocampal Interactions

The amygdala is central to the emotional enhancement of memory. During emotionally arousing events, the

amygdala becomes highly active and interacts with the hippocampus to prioritize the encoding and consolidation

of emotional information (Krenz et al., 2025; McGaugh, 2018; McGaugh, 2015; Qasim et al., 2021; Roesler et al.,

2021; LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; Paré & Headley, 2023; Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015; Hamann, 2001; McGaugh, 2004;

Zhang et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2007; Sharot et al., 2004; Dolcos et al., 2004; Murty et al., 2010). Direct brain

recordings and stimulation studies show that increased amygdala and hippocampal activity during emotional

encoding predicts better subsequent memory (Qasim et al., 2021; Roesler et al., 2021; Dolcos et al., 2004). The

amygdala’s influence is especially pronounced during the initial encounter with an emotional event, setting the

stage for stable neocortical memory representations (Krenz et al., 2025; Dolcos et al., 2004).

3.2. Neuromodulatory Systems and Stress Hormones

Emotional arousal triggers the release of stress hormones (adrenaline, glucocorticoids) and neuromodulators

(norepinephrine, dopamine), which act on the amygdala and related circuits (McGaugh, 2018; McGaugh, 2015; Paré

& Headley, 2023; Provensi et al., 2018; Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015; Schwabe et al., 2022; McIntyre et al., 2003;

McGaugh, 2004; Roozendaal & Hermans, 2017; Hu et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2016; McIntyre et al., 2012).

Noradrenergic activation, often via the locus coeruleus, enhances synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and
hippocampus, facilitating the consolidation of emotional memories (McGaugh, 2018; Provensi et al., 2018; Yonelinas

& Ritchey, 2015; McIntyre et al., 2003; Roozendaal & Hermans, 2017; Hu et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2016). The
basolateral amygdala (BLA) is particularly important for modulating these effects (Roesler et al., 2021; Paré &

Headley, 2023; McIntyre et al., 2003; McGaugh, 2004; Bocchio et al., 2017).

3.3. Network Integration and Sensory Vividness

Emotionally arousing events promote greater integration across large-scale brain networks, including the prefrontal
cortex, parietal cortex, and sensory cortices (Park et al., 2025; Todd et al., 2012; Hermans et al., 2014; Murty et al.,

2010). Emotional salience increases perceptual vividness at the time of encoding, which is reflected in stronger and

more detailed sensory representations (Todd et al., 2012; Sharot et al., 2004). This heightened sensory encoding is
mediated by amygdala-driven modulation of perceptual and mnemonic circuits (Todd et al., 2012; Sharot et al.,

2004; Murty et al., 2010).

3.4. Sleep and Memory Consolidation

Sleep, especially REM and slow-wave sleep, further consolidates emotional memories by enhancing hippocampo-

cortical and amygdalo-cortical connectivity (Payne & Kensinger, 2018; Sterpenich et al., 2007; Cairney et al., 2015).
Emotional memories are more resistant to forgetting over time, a process supported by sleep-dependent systems-

level consolidation (Payne & Kensinger, 2018; Sterpenich et al., 2007; Cairney et al., 2015).

4. Discussion

The vividness of emotional memories is underpinned by a network of neural mechanisms centered on the amygdala

and its interactions with the hippocampus and neocortex (Krenz et al., 2025; McGaugh, 2018; McGaugh, 2015;

Qasim et al., 2021; Roesler et al., 2021; LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; Paré & Headley, 2023; Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015;

Todd et al., 2012; Hamann, 2001; McGaugh, 2004; Zhang et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2007; Sharot et al., 2004; Dolcos et

al., 2004; Murty et al., 2010). Emotional arousal triggers neuromodulatory cascades that enhance synaptic plasticity

and memory consolidation, particularly through noradrenergic and glucocorticoid signaling in the amygdala and
hippocampus (McGaugh, 2018; McGaugh, 2015; Paré & Headley, 2023; Provensi et al., 2018; Yonelinas & Ritchey,

2015; McIntyre et al., 2003; McGaugh, 2004; Roozendaal & Hermans, 2017; Hu et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2016;

McIntyre et al., 2012). The amygdala’s modulation of sensory and mnemonic circuits leads to more detailed and

vivid memory traces, while large-scale network integration and sleep-dependent processes further support the

persistence and vividness of these memories (Payne & Kensinger, 2018; Park et al., 2025; Todd et al., 2012; Hermans

et al., 2014; Sterpenich et al., 2007; Cairney et al., 2015; Murty et al., 2010).

Notably, the subjective sense of vividness may be driven by strong memory for a few central details, rather than a

greater quantity of contextual information (Phelps & Sharot, 2008; Sharot et al., 2004). Negative emotional events,

in particular, are associated with increased sensory encoding and recapitulation at retrieval (Bowen et al., 2017;
Kensinger, 2009; Sharot et al., 2004). However, the same mechanisms that enhance memory vividness can also

contribute to memory distortions or maladaptive persistence, as seen in affective disorders (Krenz et al., 2025;

McGaugh, 2015; Yonelinas & Ritchey, 2015; Zhang et al., 2024; LaLumiere et al., 2017).

5. Conclusion

Emotionally charged events are remembered more vividly due to the coordinated action of the amygdala,
hippocampus, and neuromodulatory systems, which together enhance the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of

emotional information. These neural mechanisms prioritize emotionally salient details, leading to robust and vivid

memory traces.
