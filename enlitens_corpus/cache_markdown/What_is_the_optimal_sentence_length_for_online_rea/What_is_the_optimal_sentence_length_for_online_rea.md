The Optimal Sentence Length for Online Readability and Comprehension

1. Introduction

Sentence length is a critical factor in determining the readability and comprehension of online text. Research

consistently shows that shorter sentences generally enhance readability and facilitate comprehension for a broad

audience, including those with lower literacy or using assistive technologies (Kadayat & Eika, 2020; Sheppard et al.,

2014; Hanish et al., 2022; Baumann et al., 2023; Marshall et al., 2024; Baumann et al., 2024; Patel et al., 2021).

However, the optimal sentence length is not universally fixed; it can vary depending on the context, audience, and

language. Recent studies suggest that sentences ranging from 14 to 20 words strike the best balance between

clarity and information density for most online readers, with comprehension and perceived workload optimized in

this range (Kadayat & Eika, 2020; Poulimenou et al., 2016). Editing online materials to keep sentences under 15–20

words has been shown to significantly lower reading grade levels and improve user understanding (Sheppard et al.,

2014; Hanish et al., 2022; Baumann et al., 2023; Marshall et al., 2024; Baumann et al., 2024; Patel et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, factors such as sentence structure, content complexity, and reader background also play important

roles in comprehension (Meyer, 2003; Mesmer et al., 2020; Toyama, 2021; Drury, 1985). This review synthesizes the

evidence to identify the optimal sentence length for online readability and comprehension.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search targeted studies on sentence length, online readability, and

comprehension, with a focus on empirical and experimental research. Out of 1,038 identified papers, 757 were

screened, 534 met eligibility criteria, and the 47 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1 Empirical Evidence for Optimal Sentence Length

Controlled experiments and readability analyses consistently find that sentences between 14 and 20 words

maximize comprehension and minimize cognitive workload for online readers. For example, a study with screen

reader users found that comprehension and perceived workload were best with sentences of 16–20 words

(Kadayat & Eika, 2020). Another quantitative linguistics study found that short texts of 14 words achieved the

highest coherence, comprehensiveness, and readability (Poulimenou et al., 2016). Editing patient education

materials to keep sentences under 15 words led to significant improvements in readability scores and a higher

proportion of materials meeting recommended grade levels (Sheppard et al., 2014; Hanish et al., 2022; Baumann et

al., 2023; Marshall et al., 2024; Baumann et al., 2024; Patel et al., 2021).

3.2 Impact of Sentence Length Reduction

Reducing sentence length to below 15–20 words consistently lowers the reading grade level of online materials,

making them more accessible to a wider audience (Sheppard et al., 2014; Hanish et al., 2022; Baumann et al., 2023;

Marshall et al., 2024; Baumann et al., 2024; Patel et al., 2021). For example, editing medical texts to keep sentences

under 15 words improved the percentage of materials at or below the sixth-grade reading level from 0–5% to 48–

77% (Hanish et al., 2022; Baumann et al., 2023; Marshall et al., 2024; Baumann et al., 2024). This effect is robust

across different health topics and types of online content.

3.3 Variability by Audience and Context

While shorter sentences generally improve readability, the optimal length may vary by audience. For example, some

studies suggest that more advanced readers or those with higher vocabulary may benefit from slightly longer, more
complex sentences, while less proficient readers require shorter, simpler sentences (Mesmer et al., 2020; Toyama,

2021; Drury, 1985). For English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, sentence structure and syntactic cues can

sometimes be more important than length alone (Blau, 1982; Drury, 1985).

3.4 Cognitive and Perceptual Factors

Research in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology supports the finding that longer sentences increase
cognitive load and reduce comprehension, especially when they exceed 20–25 words (McLaughlin, 1974; Mikk,

2008). However, extremely short sentences can make text feel choppy and may not always enhance

understanding, especially if they disrupt logical flow (Ali, 2020; Meyer, 2003). Visual strategies, such as line
counting, can help writers identify and edit long sentences efficiently (Matthews, 2022; Matthews & Folivi, 2023).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports the recommendation that online texts should aim for sentences in the 14–20 word

range to maximize readability and comprehension for most users (Kadayat & Eika, 2020; Poulimenou et al., 2016;

Hanish et al., 2022; Baumann et al., 2023; Baumann et al., 2024). This range balances the need for clarity and

information density, reducing cognitive load without making the text feel fragmented. Editing strategies that target

sentence length, along with reducing complex words, are effective and practical for improving the accessibility of

online materials, especially in health and educational contexts (Sheppard et al., 2014; Hanish et al., 2022; Baumann
et al., 2023; Marshall et al., 2024; Baumann et al., 2024; Patel et al., 2021).

However, sentence length is not the only determinant of readability. Factors such as sentence structure,

vocabulary, content complexity, and reader background also play significant roles (Meyer, 2003; Mesmer et al.,
2020; Toyama, 2021; Drury, 1985). For specialized audiences or advanced readers, slightly longer sentences may be

appropriate, provided they maintain clarity and logical flow (Mesmer et al., 2020; Toyama, 2021). For ESL learners,

syntactic cues and coherence may be as important as sentence length (Blau, 1982; Drury, 1985). Overly short

sentences can sometimes hinder comprehension by disrupting the natural flow of information (Ali, 2020; Meyer,

2003).

5. Conclusion

The optimal sentence length for online readability and comprehension is 14–20 words, with sentences under 15

words especially effective for health and educational materials targeting a general audience. However, sentence

length should be considered alongside other factors such as structure, vocabulary, and audience needs to

maximize comprehension.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for the 14–20 word guideline, more research is needed on how sentence length interacts

with other text features and reader characteristics, especially in digital and multilingual contexts.
