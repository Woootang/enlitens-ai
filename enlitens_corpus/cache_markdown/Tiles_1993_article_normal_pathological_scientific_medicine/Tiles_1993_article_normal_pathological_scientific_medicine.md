DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper by Mary Tiles explores Georges Canguilhem's historical and philosophical 
examination of the distinction between the normal and the pathological. It critiques the
modern tendency in scientific medicine to equate health with statistical normality, 
arguing that this overlooks the individual's capacity to adapt and establish new vital 
norms. The article presents Canguilhem's alternative definition of health as a margin of 
tolerance and the ability to overcome illness, challenging the purely quantitative and 
objective basis of modern physiology and medical practice.

ABSTRACT

In this paper it is suggested that Canguilhem's examination of the history of the 
distinction between the normal and the pathological contains material of relevance to 
current debates about the nature of medicine, in particular concerning the status of 
quantitative indicators as indicators of the need for medical intervention. His arguments 
against the equation of health with normality are presented, together with his own 
suggested definition of health and the implications of this definition for physiology and 
medicine.

The concept of norm is an original concept which, in physiology more than 
elsewhere, cannot be reduced to an objective concept determinable by 
scientific methods. Strictly speaking then, there is no biological science of 
the normal. There is a science of biological situations called normal. That 
science is physiology.

Canguilhem ([1978], p. 138)

This is the provocative conclusion which Canguilhem reached at the end of his doctoral
thesis (published in 1943). When he returned to the same topic twenty years later 
(1963-6) this conclusion was not substantially altered, although it was nuanced by the 
introduction of consideration of the importance of the social environment of human 
beings, of the social conditions for the emergence of modern medicine, and the 
introduction of the concept of 'error' into pathology. These additions can be understood 
as a reaction to Foucault's work The Birth of the Clinic, which appeared in 1963 in a 
series edited by Canguilhem. Indeed there are many respects in which Foucault's work
complements Canguilhem's. Foucault examined the historical period (late eighteenth 
and early nineteenth centuries) immediately prior to Canguilhem's starting point. 
Whereas Foucault was concerned with the period in which the epistemological field of 
medicine is reformed and restructured in such a way that the distinction between the 
normal and the pathological comes to be central in the constitution of the object of 
scientific medicine, Canguilhem was concerned with the nature of the discipline 
whose object is constituted in this way. The move toward a self-consciously scientific 
medicine goes hand in hand with a shift in the concept of health in which health is 
primarily identified with normality. As Foucault explains:

Generally speaking it might be said that up to the end of the eighteenth 
century medicine related much more to health than to normality; it did not 
begin by analyzing a 'regular' functioning of the organism and go on to seek 
where it had deviated, what it was disturbed by, and how it could be brought 
back into normal working order; it referred, rather, to qualities of vigour, 
suppleness and fluidity. which were lost in illness and which it was the task 
of medicine to restore. To this extent medical practice could accord an 
important place to regimen and diet, in short, to a whole rule of life and 
nutrition that the subject imposed on himself. This privileged relation 
between medicine and health involved the possibility of being one's own 
physician. Nineteenth century medicine, on the other hand, was regulated 
more in accordance with normality than with health; it formed its concepts 
and prescribed its interventions in relation to a standard of functioning and 
organic structure, and physiological knowledge once marginal and purely 
theoretical knowledge for the doctor-was to become established at the very 
center of all medical reflection when one spoke of the life of groups and 
societies, of the life of the race, or even of the psychological life, one did not 
think first of the internal structure of the organized being, but of the medical 
polarity of the normal and the pathological. (Foucault [1963], p. 35)

But why should these historical discussions, neither of them very new, be of any general
concern or interest? Because in the present climate of debate about medicine in 
particular, and science and technology more generally, it is necessary to raise the 
question of the nature of claims to scientific status, not in order to discredit them, but in 
order to make the issues explicit. There can neither be a sensible response to the 
claims of alternative medicines, nor a sensible debate about the merits and 
disadvantages of high technology medicine if the scientificity of current, institutionalized 
medical practice is simply taken for granted in a dogmatic assertion, where the 

technological and the quantitative are aligned automatically with the scientifically 
progessive. A reasoned, and indeed a scientifically rational, response requires a more 
critical and more concretely based understanding of what is, or could be, required of a 
scientific medicine. There has been, in recent years a return to placing more 
emphasis on 'healthy living' but we need to enquire about the concept of health 
involved here. With what authority can one be told by one's doctor that one ought to 
take medication to reduce one's blood pressure, ought to go on a fat-free, salt-free diet, 
eat oat bran, or whatever? There is, moreover, a prima-facie ground for thinking that 
there are here relationships and formations which are not well understood. The 
conception of a scientific medicine immediately brings with it the conception of a body 
of practice founded in theory, theory which is itself the product of basic scientific 
research. Yet it is this relationship which, like that between science and technology has,
until recently, received little attention from philosophers of science, because it was 
presumed to be straightforward. To have realized that it is not straightforward is itself 
progress, but that does not mean that there is as yet any achieved understanding.

The straightfoward picture of the relationship between basic scientific knowledge and 
the practice based on it is that the basic science gives objective, purely factual 
knowledge of the general laws governing a specific kind of phenomena. Practice 
involves dealing with particular situations in which these kinds of phenomena occur. The
basic general laws can then be applied to the particular situations (universal quantifier 
elimination) to provide predictions of what will happen when given combinations of 
conditions are realized. This gives rise to purely factual hypothetical imperatives of the 
form 'If you want to do X, then it can be done by doing Y or Z'. Here it is assumed that 
the practical goals are set independently; science has nothing to say about which goals 
should or should not be selected. In other words it is the function of science to establish 
the facts, independently of all consideration of values. Since courses of action are 
directed toward ends dictated by values, these values must be supplied by individuals 
or societies, and it follows that no practice can be wholly scientific--there can be no 
science of what ought to be done in relation to a given range of phenomena. How then 
could the conception of a scientific medicine, a practice whose imperatives 
themselves have scientific status, ever arise?

However, a moment's historical reflection will show that this is the wrong question. The 
better question would be why haven't more questions been raised about the claims of 
medicine to scientific status, given the general climate of divorce between fact and 
value, theory and practice? For Plato and Aristotle it is quite natural to include medicine 
as a science alongside ethics, biology, and physics. In studying the good for man this 
must include his physical as well as his moral well-being. But when teleology is 
banished from science, the good for man, whether physical or moral, ceases to be a 
legitimate object of scientific enquiry. Science cannot, or is not supposed to, consider 
things as having ends, purposes or goals. It would seem that health, physical well-
being, should go the way of virtue. That is has not is due to the assumption that it is 
possible to define physical health in purely physicalist, physiological terms via the 
distinction between the normal and the pathological (normal is healthy) without a whiff
of teleology, hence the centrality of the normal and the pathological in an examination 
of the scientific status of medicine. Canguilhem says:

The ambition to make pathology, and consequently therapeutics, completely 
scientific by making them derive from a previously established physiology 
would make sense only if, first, the normal could be defined in a purely 
objective way, as a fact, and second, all the differences between the normal
state and the pathological state could be expressed in quantitative terms, 
for only quantity can take into account both homogeneity and variation. 
(Canguilhem [1978]. p. 23)

The strategy required is clearly illustrated in Durkheim's discussion of the rules for 
distinguishing the normal from the pathological. He takes it that medicine is already 
established as a practice which is scientific in a way that few other practices are and 
seeks to regain the connection between theory and practice at the level of social and 
political action.

For societies, as for individuals, health is good and desirable; sickness, on 
the other hand, is bad and must be avoided. If therefore we find an objective 
criterion, inherent in the fact themselves, to allow us to distinguish 
scientifically health from sickness in the various orders of social 
phenomena, science will be in a position to throw light on practical matters 
while remaining true to its own method. (Durkheim [1895], p. 86)

Much of the credit for developing a methodology for experimental physiology and for 
the vision of a medicine which is scientific in the modern sense goes to Claude 
Bernard. The basis for Bernard's claim that physiology should be genuinely 
experimental was his vision of a universal determinism. There are laws governing living 
systems which are identical in kind with those governing non-living systems. These can 
only be discovered experimentlly for, citing Bacon, it is only through experiment that we 
can come to a knowledge of those laws that increase our mastery over nature.

The intellectual conquest of man consists in diminishing indeterminism to the
extent that with the aid of experimental method it wins ground for 
determinism. This alone can satisfy his ambition, for it is by this means that 
he extends and will extend more and more his power over nature. (Bernard 
[1865]. p. 196)

Physiology must then be experimental if it is to be the ground of technological 
intervention in and mastery over the phenomena of living organisms in general and of 
human beings in particular. Moreover, this vision of an experimentally based medicine is
regarded as a final displacement of all values and all subjectivity from medicine.

experimental medicine is not a new system of medicine, but, on the contrary.
the negation of all systems. In effect, the advance of experimental medicine 
will result in the disappearance from that science of all individual views, 
replacing them by impersonal general theories which will, as in other 

sciences, only be a reasoned and regular co-ordination of facts furnished by 
experience. (Bernard [1865], p. 301)

It is this idea that both Foucault and Canguilhem seek to undermine, the idea that 
medicine is scientific in the sense that its object (both in the sense of goal and of object 
of knowledge) is subject to completely factual, objective, determination. Both utilize the 
history of medicine to demonstrate that its objective is not a natural 'given'. Here I am 
focussing on Canguilhem's argument's since these are designed to reflect directly on to 
medicine as currently constituted rather than on the conditions for its emergence. The 
interest of the strategies employed both by Foucault and Canguilhem lies in the fact 
that they do not seek to reinstate a rigid fact-value distinction. They do not argue that 
medical practice, centered on health, cannot be scientifically grounded because of the 
value-ladenness of the concept of health; i.e. they do not argue that the goal of medical
practice is set independently of the medical sciences such as physiology, and could 
thus be altered without affecting the content or the methodology of those medical 
sciences. Rather, they are concerned to reveal the ways in which there are values 
intrinsic to and built into the very framework of the conception of medical sciences as 
linked to the possibility of a scientific medicine. Thus Canguilhem's arguments turn on 
an insistence on the specificity of the object (in the sense of object of knowledge) of the 
life sciences, which renders these sciences distinctive in character and makes it 
impossible wholly to assimilate them, either methodologically or epistemologically, to 
sciences such as physics and chemistry. This is part of a more general strategy to force
a reconceptualization of the scientific and to move away from the positivist conception 
of science as wholly objective, factual, purely descriptive, etc. That medicine is not 
scientific in the positivist sense does not mean that it is discredited; it does mean that in 
so far as its practices have been shaped by an image of itself as scientific in this sense 
it is open to criticism, and it also means that its imperatives cannot claim the authority of
absolute, factual backing; its claims to authority must themselves be re-evaluated.

Canguilhem's stated aim was to show the inadequacy of the principle of pathology 
which asserts that the morbid state of a living being is a simple quantitative variation on 
the physiological phenomena which define the normal state of the corresponding 
function. An outline of the issue he wants to address and the direction from which he 
approaches is roughly as follows. Throughout the history of the various specifications of 
the concept of disease there runs a common thread-disease is negatively valued; to be
sick is to be harmful or undesirable or socially devalued in some way. Positive values 
attach to things like life, long life, the capacity for reproduction and for physical work, 
strength, resistance to fatigue, absence of pain, etc. From the physiological point of 
view what is desired in health is thus fairly obvious and this gives the everyday concept 
of physical disease a relatively stable basis. But medical science is not advanced by 
analysing this everyday concept of disease. Its task is to determine what are the 
underlying vital phenomena which lead men to call themselves sick, to determine their 
origins, laws of evolution and the actions which modify them. In specifying these 
phenomena the everyday value-laden concepts disappear, but the vocabulary of 
disease is still used because medical activity is essentially linked to patients and their 
value judgement via clinical questioning and therapeutics. A doctor is interested in 

diagnosis and cure, where curing is taken to mean restoring a function or an organism 
to the norm from which it has deviated. He derives his conception of the norm from 
three sources-from physiology, as the science of normal man, from clinical 
experience, and from the representation of the norm which is dominant in the society 
within which he is working. Of these three, physiology is presumed to provide the 
ultimate court of scientific appeal. Modern physiology is presented as a canonical 
collection of functional constants and these are termed normal both in so far as they 
designate average characteristics and because they enter into the normative activity of 
therapeutics. Physiological constants are thus normal in both a descriptive and a 
normative sense. The question, as Canguilhem sees it, is whether it is medicine which 
converts a purely descriptive sense of norm derived from physiology into a biological 
ideal and thus (as the straightforward positivist picture requires) grafts on this normative
element by making restoration of normal function its goal. In this case medical values 
would be superimposed on physiology to yield medical practice. Or is it that the 
normative element is already present in the physiological concept of the normal so that 
medicine derives from physiology a conception of what should be its aim, as 
envisaged by Bernard and the conception of a wholly scientific medicine (medical 
practice)? In this case physiology is already delivering scientifically determined 
medical goals in accordance with the positivist idea that technology should be the 
application of a science; physiology must throw light on pathology in order to establish 
and scientifically ground therapeutics; logically we can, on this view, only progress from 
experimental physiology to medical technology and practice. Canguilhem's argument 
will be to the effect that one cannot have it both ways. To the extent that physiology 
conforms to the positivist ideal of a science, it cannot determine medical goals and the 
debate about what are appropriate medical goals and appropriate procedures would 
have the status of ethical disputes. To the extent that physiology does deliver 
guidelines for medical practice it does not conform to the positivist image of science but 
is able to supply norms to medical practice only because medical practice has itself 
informed and directed the development of physiological conceptions, so leading to the 
incorporation of a normative component in the physiological conception of the normal.

Slippage is possible here because of an ambiguity in the concept of the normal 
between that which is usual and that which is as it ought to be. This ambiguity extends 
to physiologically based medicine, where the normal state designates both the habitual 
state of the organs and their ideal-ideal because establishment of the habitual state is 
the ordinary therapeutic aim. To make his case Canguilhem needs to argue that there 
can be no purely scientific (in the positivist sense) definition of the normal which would 
bridge the gap between theory and practice without relying on this ambiguity, i.e. a 
definition of health as normality is impossible. This requires argument both against 
definition of the normal in terms of an ideal of physiological function (attempted by 
Bernard) and against definition of the normal in statistical terms.

The case against defining the normal in terms of ideal physiological function, as 
suggested by Bernard, can be illustrated by reference to Bernard's work on diabetes. In 
describing this work Canguilhem shows how physiological understanding is gained, but
from a perspective which eliminates the distinction between the normal and the 
pathological conceived as the distinction between health and disease. Bernard 

showed that the sugar found in an animal organism is produced by that organism, which
implies that blood sugar levels (glycemia) do not depend directly on sugar intake. The 
presence of sugar in the urine (glycosuria) is then shown to be a consequence of the 
rise of the blood sugar level above a certain quantity which serves as a threshold. Urine 
is considered as a product of renal secretion, and glycosuria as an excess of blood 
sugar (glycemia) pouring over a threshold. The difference responsible for glycosuria is 
purely quantitative; glucose production and renal secretion are qualitatively the same. In
making this variation understandable at the physiological level it is explained in terms of 
the normal (law-goverened) operation of physiological mechanisms. But when 
glycosuria is regarded as a major symptom of diabetes, the presence of sugar in the 
urine makes it qualitatively different from normal urine.

The problem with the descent to pure physiological mechanisms is that it leaves the 
qualitative difference between normal and pathological at the level of illusory 
appearance. What Canguilhem points out is that Bernard's conception of a scientific 
medicine grounded in physiology can seem possible because there are always two 
ways of looking at a physiological state. (i) It can be viewed as a simple summary of 
quantities, without considering questions of biological value; the body can be 
considered simply as a complex physical and chemical mechanism. From this point of 
view there is a natural continuity between physiology and physics and chemistry. But 
the physical and chemical state of a mechanism cannot be called healthy, normal, 
diseased, or pathological. 'Normal and pathological have no meaning on a scale 
where the biological object is reduced to colloidal equilibria and ionized solutions' 
(Canguilhem [1978], p. 59). (ii) The physiological state can be viewed as one which has 
a qualitative value for the living organism, in which case there will not be a continuity 
between normal and pathological states.

Because physiology stands at the cross-roads of the laboratory and the 
clinic, two points of view about biological phenomena are adopted there, but 
this does not mean that they can be interchanged. The substitution of 
quantitative progression for qualitative contrast in no way annuls this 
opposition. It always remains at the back of the mind of those who have 
chosen to adopt the theoretical and metrical point of view. (Canguilhem 
[1978], p. 58)

To reduce the difference between a healthy man and a diabetic to a 
quantitative difference of the amount of glucose within the body; to delegate 
the task of distinguishing one who is diabetic from one who is not to a renal 
threshold conceived simply as a quantitative difference of level, means 
obeying the spirit of the physical sciences which, in buttressing phenomena 
with laws can explain them only in terms of their reduction of a common 
measure. (ibid., p. 58)

If physiology were to living bodies what astronomy, dynamics, hydraulics, hydrostatics,
etc. are to inert ones then there would be no space left for pathology. There is no 
pathology of inert bodies.

Is a person to be treated as sick simply because his blood pressure deviates from a 
given norm, because his blood sugar levels are abnormal, because his cholesterol level 
is too high, etc.? Is failure to conform to the norm ground for medical intervention? 
These become pressing questions when such tests are used by insurance companies 
for the setting of rates for life and medical insurance. How are physiological norms to be
determined? Bernard's view was that the physiologically normal is to be defined in 
terms of an ideal type realized in precise experimental conditions and was throroughly 
opposed to use of statistical notions. But the notion of an ideal type as the type not 
merely from which explanations start but at which medical practice should aim already 
imports values. What guarantees that a mode of functioning, deviations from which can 
be explained by reference to interfering factors (the ideal function from an explanatory 
point of view), will coincide with the ideal at which medical practice should aim?

The more promising route for one concerned to obtain a scientifically respectable 
definition of the normal is to incorporate a use of statistics into the understanding of 
mechanisms and functions supplied by physiology. Canguilhem does not set his face 
against all use of statistical methods. He acknowledges that in biology it is necessary, in
order to represent a species, to give norms which are empirically determined averages. 
But this determination of the normal (typical) members of a species by no means 
entails that every member of the species which deviates from those norms is abnormal. 
All real individuals will diverge in some degree or other from these norms; it is in this 
that their individuality consists and on which the possibility of evolution by natural 
selection depends.

This, however, does not rule out the possibility of a reverse connection— that averages 
may be viewed as the expression of norms. The human type- the average man-might 
be determined as being such that those who most closely resemble him are most 
common wheras those who diverge most are rare. The problem with this supposition is 
that the norms expressed in human averages may not be purely biological norms, but 
may be a reflection of ways of life, themselves an expression of human values.

If it is true that the human body is in one sense a product of social activity, it 
is not absurd to assume that the constancy of certain traits, revealed by an 
average. depends on the conscious or unconscious fidelity to certain norms 
of life. Consequently, in the human species, statistical frequency expresses 
not only vital, but also social normativity. A human trait would not be 
normal because frequent, but frequent because normal, that is, normative 
in one given kind of life, taking these words 'kind of life' in the sense given to 
them by human geographers. (Canguilhem [1978], p. 92)

For example, average life span, or post-natal mortality for infants up to five years 
depends on, amongst other things, the techniques of collective hygiene. provision of 

medical facilities, etc. which in turn reflect the value attached to life by a given society. 
In this case the average life span is not a biologically determined norm. The average 
expresses social norms. This opens up the space of comparative anatomy and 
physiology alongside consideration of regional variations in relation to environmental, 
social, and life-style differences. For example, a study of Brazzaville natives revealed 66
per cent of them as hypoglycemic, with 39 per cent ranging from 0.9 g to 0.75 g and 27 
per cent below 0.75 g. These are levels which would be considered grave, if not fatal, in
Europeans, yet are withstood by African blacks without apparent disturbance and 
without convulsions or coma. The causes for the hypoglycemia could be found in their 
conditions of life, chronic undernourishment, chronic and polymorphous intestinal 
parasitism and malaria. The tolerance of it could then be seen as an adaption to these 
living conditions.

It follows from the views just outlined that a statistically obtained average cannot provide
the doctor with a criterion of whether the individual before him is or is not in a normal or
healthy state. 'We cannot start from it in order to discharge our medical duty toward the 
individual.' If tradition is to be believed, Napoleon had a resting pulse rate of 40 when in 
good health, yet the average for the healthy member of this species is around 70. The 
view which Canguilhem has been urging is that the normal is neither an average nor 
the reflection of a law of normal functioning, but is a norm which is capable of being 
transformed in the specific context of an individual member of the species and of his 
relation to the particular environment in which he lives. This means that at the level of 
quantitative generalizations the boundary between the normal and the pathological 
will necessarily be imprecise, even though it will be quite precise for each individual.

Thus Canguilhem concludes that the concepts of normal and average are to be 
regarded as distinct concepts. This is the negative claim. The positive theses 
concerning health, physiology, and medicine are founded in Canguilhem's view that 
values enter into the very constitution of the domain of the life sciences, not as elements
which are arbitrarily or subjectively imposed on them, but as inherent in the object of 
study.

It is life itself and not medical judgement which makes the biological normal 
a concept of value and not a concept of statistical reality. For the physician, 
life is not an object, but rather a polarized activity, whose spontaneous effort 
of defense and struggle against all that is of negative value is extended by 
medicine by bringing to bear the relative but indispensable light of human 
science. (Canguilhem [1978], p. 73)

The basic fact on which Canguilhem insists is that there is no biological indifference. It 
is the framework of a biology of natural selection itself which introduces this valuation 
along with notions of adaptive value, selective advantage, and so on. The whole basis 
of the theory of natural selection is that the differences resulting from random variation 
are not all of equal survival value. Here it is the polarity of life and death which is the 
source of the value. This dynamic polarity of living beings finds expression in normative 
activity. There are healthy biological norms and pathological ones and they are not the 

same. The definition of health must thus be one which (a) makes sense at the level of 
the individual and (b) is in full accord with the biological conception of man as a living 
being. Health is that which confers survival value, i.e. adaptability. It is also the feeling 
of being able to establish vital norms, of being able to cope with challenges presented. It
is the ideal from which the image of the athlete derives its seductive power-she is one 
who can transcend the physiological limitation incorporated into the characterization of 
women. establishing and living by a new set of physiological norms. She is thus seen as
an embodiment of biological normativity. (In this image the reality, the price paid for 
athletic specialization, is absent.)

Health is a margin of tolerance of the inconstancies of the environment... 
What characterizes health is the possibility of transcending the norm, which 
defines the momentary normal, the possibility of tolerating infractions of the 
habitual norm and instituting new norms in new situations.

To be in good health means being able to fall sick and recover, it is a 
biological luxury. (Canguilhem [1978], pp. 115-16)

Disease is then characterized as a reduction in the margin of tolerance for the 
inconstancies of the environment. Here it should be emphasized that the environment 
includes the totality of conditions which may affect an organism's functions and in the 
case of human beings this includes the social environment. The danger of diseases 
such as measles lies not in the threat which they immediately pose to the healthy 
person, but in their potential for reducing the person's ability to face other diseases the 
concern over measles is with the possibility of pneumonia and other complications. 
Similarly diabetes is not so serious if it is just glycosuria-but coma and gangrene are 
another matter. Hemophilia is not in itself life threatening, so long as traumatism does 
not occur-but in what range of conditions can that be assured?

What, now, are the implications of this definition of health for physiology? 
Canguilhem has clearly rejected Bernard's definition of physiology as the science of 
normal functioning (i) because he has rejected the equation of health with normality, 
(ii) because he has rejected the idea that there can be any ontological grounding for the 
notion of normal functioning at the level of the biological type the level at which 
physiology, as a science dealing in generalization, would have to work, (iii) because he
rejects the equation of the pathological with the abnormal. On his account of disease it
involves the institution of new functional norms which are precarious in relation to 
change in environmental conditions. Once again the fundamental point is that 
physiology must be seen as a biological science, a science which has living beings as 
its object of study.

The laws of physics and chemistry do not vary according to health or 
disease. But to fail to admit that from a biological point of view, life 
differentiates between its states means condemning oneself to be even 
unable to distinguish food from excrement. Certainly a living being's 

excrement can be food for another living being but not for him. What 
distinguishes food from excrement is no physico-chemical reality but a 
biological value. Likewise, what distinguishes the physiological from the 
pathological is not a physico-chemical reality but a biological value. 
(Canguilhem [1978]. p. 130)

Of what, then, is physiology the science? The answer suggested is that physiology is 
the science of stabilized modes of life, where modes of life are divided into two 
fundamental kinds:

(1) those whose stability will not prevent them from being altered and re-established-the
normal (normative) mode of life (normally functioning immune system-immunity);

(2) those whose stability is tenuously clung to because disruption is threatening-the 
pathological (non-normative) mode of life, even though the stability expresses a kind of 
normality so long as the being is alive (pathologically functioning immune system-
allergy).

It is not the job of physiology to look for an objective definition of the normal, but rather
to recognize the normative character of life. The role of physiology would then be to 
determine exactly the content of the norms to which life has succeeded in fixing itself 
without prejudicing the possibility or impossibility of eventually correcting these norms. 
In so far as physiology works to determine the constants and invariants which define 
the phenomena of life and does so by scientific methods, it is a science in every sense. 
In so far as it looks for the vital significance of these constants, it goes beyond what is 
undertaken in sciences such as physics and chemistry. For to take this step involves 
considering life not as timeless and unchanging but as constituted by a polarized 
movement. The bio-chemist and the bio-physicist study matter from a different point of 
view than the chemist and the physicist. Moreover the biological point of view adopted 
by the physiologist is the point of view of a living being. The categories of health and 
disease are introduced into human consciousness because they are living beings; this 
consciousness is an expression of their experience of their own biological polarity.

The fact is that the physiologist's scientific activity, however separate and 
autonomous he may conceive it to be in his laboratory, maintains a more or 
less close, but unquestionable relationship with medical activity... The 
categories of health and disease are biologically technical and subjective, 
not biologically scientific and objective. Living beings prefer health to 
disease... The physiologist is often a physician, always a living man, and 
this is why the physiologist includes in his basic concepts the fact that if the 
living being's functions assume modes all equally explicable by the scientist, 
they are not for this reaon the same for the living being himself. (Canguilhem
[1978]. p. 132)

This brings us to the relation between physiology and medicine. The fact that human 
beings are conscious of and seek to understand and cure their own diseases is seen as

introducing an epistemological and conceptual structure for medicine which renders it 
distinct from sciences such as physics and chemistry, and even other branches of 
biology, for here the patient, or man as potential patient, is both subject and object of 
study. In this case to allow that the notion of disease must ultimately be tied back to the
value judgments of the sick man is not to introduce a wholly illegitimate subjectivity, for 
it is the sick person who is also the object of knowledge so that his values are internal to
the object of study and so form part of the object domain.

We think that medicine exists as the art of life because the living human 
being himself calls certain dreaded states or behaviors pathological (hence 
requiring avoidance or correction) We think that in doing this the living 
human being, in a more or less lucid way, extends a spontaneous effort, 
peculiar to life, to struggle against that which obstructs its preservation and 
development taken as norms. the fact that a living man reacts to a lesion, 
infection, functional anarchy by means of disease, expresses the 
fundamental fact that life is not indifferent to the conditions in which it is 
possible, that life is a polarity and thereby even an unconscious position of 
value; in short, life is in fact a normative activity. (Canguilhem [1978]. p. 70)

In other words, the expression of disease by a patient and its negative valuation have 
simultaneously a subjective and an objective status; the negative valuation is not 
introduced only in the patient's verbalization or in his or the doctor's conceptualization of
his state but is present in the state viewed as the state of a living being which is being 
expressed through his behavior. This does not mean that the patient has an objectively 
correct or privileged view of the nature of his disease or even that human 
conceptualization determines what are vital norms. It is simply viewing verbalizations 
and conceptualizations as part of behavior expressive of and prompted by the disruption
of vital norms. It does mean, however, that the business of the definition of disease 
should not be handed over to anatomy and physiology, rather, clinical practice, 
medical and surgical practice should have a continuing input into physiology and 
pathology. Medical practice cannot be grounded in an independently derived body of 
basic science. The conflict between physiologically and anatomically based definitions 
of disease and those derived from the experience of the patient is itself to be explained 
by reference to clinical practice. The doctor may be able to see a patient in someone 
who does not feel himself to be one on the basis of accumulated experience derived 
from those who have in the past presented themselves as patients and the results of 
diagnostic techniques performed on them. (An illustration of the way in which clinical 
and basic research interact in the production of physiological knowledge is provided in 
Star [1986].)

To summarize: the healthy state cannot be equated with the normal state. A person is 
healthy in so far as she is normative relative to fluctuations in her environment. Cure is 
the regaining of stabilized physical norms and is more or less effective depending on 
the robustness or fragility of the stabilization. But no cure returns the system to 
biological innocence; cures always involve the institution of new norms of life, 
sometimes superior to the old ones.

This emphasis on health as opposed to normality is of interest in the context of more 
recent debates concerning the character of medicine, where a positive concept of 
health has once again come to be pushed into the foreground. The problem is that it 
has re-emerged in two very disparate forms: as an ill-articulated and highly subjective 
concept, ill adapted for dialogue with, let alone for incorporation into the framework of, a
medicine which sees itself as scientific; the other presenting itself as scientific, coming 
with quantitative tests and physiological explanations derived from statistical definitions 
of normality. Where medical care is financed by private insurance, preventive medicine
is aimed at getting the majority of the population to conform to the norms of those who 
have in the past been statistically good risks for medical insurance companies.

Canguilhem, on the other hand, presents a rigorously articulated concept of health, 
one which is grounded back into the general framework of biological science and which 
incorporates the gains which have been derived from advances in our understanding of 
the internal structures, mechanisms and functions of living organisms. There is 
doubtless much here that can be criticized but, it seems to me, it does at least provide a
starting point for serious discussion as well as a model for what is required of a critique 
of scientific medicine mounted with the aim of reconnecting the psychological, 
subjective awareness of disease with its medical understanding, and of resisting the 
downgrading of clinical judgment of individuals in favor of quantitative, technically 
sophisticated tests processed in large batches.
