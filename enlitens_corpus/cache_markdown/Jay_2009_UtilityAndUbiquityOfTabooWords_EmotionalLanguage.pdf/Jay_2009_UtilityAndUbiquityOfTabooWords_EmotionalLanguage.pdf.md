DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper argues that the scientific study of taboo words (swearing) is essential for a complete 
understanding of language and emotion. Author Timothy Jay demonstrates the "ubiquity" of 
swearing—showing it constitutes 0.3-0.7% of daily speech—and its "utility" as a powerful tool for
emotional expression, coping, and achieving social goals. By challenging the myths that 
swearing is rare or meaningless, the paper critiques sanitized models of language and supports 
an approach that recognizes the importance of a person's full, authentic, and emotionally 
expressive vocabulary, which can only be captured in contexts like a clinical interview, not a 
standardized test.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"When scholars disregard or dismiss swearing as irrelevant to a complete understanding of 
language, we are left with a polite or sanitized and therefore false science of language."

"The uniquely human facility for swearing evolved and persists because taboo words can 
communicate emotion information (anger, frustration) more readily than nontaboo words, 
allowing speakers to achieve a variety of personal and social goals with them (utility)."

"The ultimate offensiveness of words is determined entirely by pragmatic variables such as 
speaker-listener relationship and social-physical setting, as well as the words used and tone of 
voice."

"Swearing is like using the horn on your car, which can be used to signify a number of emotions 
(e.g., anger, frustration, joy, surprise)."

"Two-thirds of our swearing data are linked to personal and interpersonal expressions of anger 
and frustration, which seem to be the main reason for swearing."

"

Fuck you! immediately conveys a level of contempt unparalleled by nontaboo words; there is no 
way to convey Fuck you! with polite speech."

"Swear words persist through parents' attempts to eliminate them as parental sanctions have 
virtually no effect on swearing rates when children reach adulthood."

"Media ignore situations where swearing is beneficial, such as when it is cathartic or a useful 
substitute for physical violence."

"Pinker (1994, p. 334) asserted that swearing is not 'genuine language' because it is the product
of subcortical brain activity. Pinker's emotional versus nonemotional dichotomy is false because 
languages produce a wide range of emotional expressions."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Ubiquity/Frequency: Field studies consistently find that taboo words make up 0.3% to 
0.7% of daily spoken language. Based on an average of 15,000-16,000 words spoken 
per day, this translates to an estimated 80-90 taboo words uttered daily per person. The 
frequency of taboo words (0.5%) is comparable to the frequency of first-person plural 
pronouns like "we," "us," and "our" (1.0%).

● Common Lexicon: Despite hundreds of available taboo words, most public swearing 
relies on a small, stable set of 10 terms which account for roughly 80% of usage. This 
list includes
 fuck, shit, hell, damn, goddamn, Jesus Christ, ass, oh my god, bitch, and sucks.

● Personality Correlates:
○ Swearing is

 positively correlated with extraversion and Type A hostility.

○ Swearing is

 negatively correlated with agreeableness, conscientiousness, religiosity, and 
sexual anxiety.

● Gender Differences: Men historically swear more in public than women, though the gap

narrowed from 67% of swearing episodes in 1986 to 55% in 2006. Men use more 
offensive words like
 fuck and shit more frequently, while women are five times more likely than men to use 
the mild expletive "oh my god," which accounted for 24% of women's swearing in 2006.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Acquisition of Taboo Status

The paper proposes that words acquire their taboo power and their ability to arouse autonomic 
properties through aversive classical conditioning during childhood. Children are punished by 

caregivers for using certain words, which conditions an emotional response to them. This 
personal learning is later reinforced by an awareness of institutional standards from religion, 
law, and media that sanction this speech.

Functionalist View of Language

The author advocates for a functionalist approach to language ("Why do people speak to each 
other?") over a purely structuralist one ("What are the rules that generate sentences?"). A 
functionalist view avoids the "emotion gap" of structuralism by directly addressing the emotional 
and social goals people achieve with speech, including rude, offensive, and impolite language. 
This framework recognizes that communicating emotion is a primary function of language, and 
taboo words are a uniquely effective tool for this purpose.

Neuro-Psycho-Social (NPS) Model of Swearing

This comprehensive framework, proposed by the author, specifies that any act of swearing 
originates from an interdependent nexus of three conditions:

1. Neurological state: The speaker's nervous system state, including autonomic arousal 

or brain dysfunction (e.g., Tourette's, aphasia).

2. Psychological status: The speaker's personality traits (e.g., agreeableness, hostility) 

and emotional state (e.g., anger).

3. Social context: The speaker's sensitivity to social rules, the speaker-listener 

relationship, and the physical setting.
 The model aims to predict the likelihood and form of swearing by considering all three 
factors simultaneously. For example, it explains why Tourette's coprolalia is culturally 
specific: the neurological condition manifests through the specific words and gestures 
deemed most taboo by the individual's social learning.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

● Tourette's Syndrome: The uncontrollable swearing (coprolalia) seen in some 

individuals with Tourette's Syndrome is culturally specific. A Japanese person with TS is 
more likely to yell ancestral allusions (e.g., "shit grandma!"), reflecting a high taboo in 
that culture, whereas an American is more likely to yell
 fuck or use the middle finger. This demonstrates the deep interplay between a 
neurological condition and social learning.

● Children and Adolescents: Children's sense of what is offensive differs from adults'; for
example, young boys find words like "baby" or "wimp" more offensive than their parents 
do. Swearing rates tend to peak during the teenage years and decline thereafter.

● Bilingual Speakers: Non-native speakers may know a taboo word is offensive but often 
lack the nuanced, native-level folk knowledge of when and where it is appropriate to use 
it. Native speakers are more sensitive than bilinguals to how context (like speaker 
status) affects the offensiveness of taboo words.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Critique of Research Practices

The paper strongly criticizes the common practice in psychological research of using written-
word frequency counts (like the Kucera & Francis, 1967 corpus) to estimate the frequency of 
taboo words. This is a major flaw because written estimates grossly underrepresent the actual 
frequency of swearing in everyday spoken language. This misperception leads researchers to 
make erroneous assumptions (e.g., that taboo words are low-frequency) which can compromise
experimental designs, such as when selecting control words.

Implications for Clinical and Social Issues

An understanding of the psychology of swearing has direct relevance to real-world problems:

● Anger Management: It suggests that interventions should help people, especially 

children, cope with the underlying anger and frustration that motivates swearing, rather 
than focusing solely on punishing the language itself.

● Verbal Abuse and Harassment: Psychological insights can help legal and workplace 

scholarship better define what constitutes harmful or abusive speech.

● Parenting: Parental sanctions have little to no effect on eventual adult swearing rates, 

suggesting that punishment is an ineffective strategy.
