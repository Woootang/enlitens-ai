Memory reconsolidation in therapy: mechanisms and necessary conditions

1. Introduction

Memory reconsolidation is a neurobiological process whereby reactivated memories become temporarily labile

and susceptible to modification before being restabilized. This phenomenon has generated significant interest as a

potential mechanism for therapeutic interventions targeting maladaptive memories in conditions such as PTSD,

substance use disorders, and anxiety disorders (Lee et al., 2017; Elsey et al., 2018; Elsey & Kindt, 2017; Dunbar &

Taylor, 2017; Huang et al., 2024; Milton, 2023; Taylor et al., 2009; Barak & Goltseker, 2021; Chen et al., 2025; Phelps

& Hofmann, 2019). Reconsolidation-based therapies aim to disrupt or update problematic memories, offering the

possibility of more enduring symptom relief compared to traditional extinction-based approaches, which often

leave the original memory intact and susceptible to relapse (Kroes et al., 2016; Elsey & Kindt, 2017; Elsey et al.,

2018; Taylor et al., 2009; Barak & Goltseker, 2023; Chen et al., 2025). However, the translation of reconsolidation

research from animal models to clinical practice is complex, with several necessary conditions and boundary

factors influencing whether reconsolidation can be induced and harnessed therapeutically (Elsey & Kindt, 2017;

Treanor et al., 2017; Bolsoni & Zuardi, 2019; Sinclair & Barense, 2019; Wideman et al., 2018). This review synthesizes

the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying memory reconsolidation, the conditions required for its

induction, and the implications for clinical interventions.

2. Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

sources such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy targeted foundational mechanisms, necessary

conditions, therapeutic applications, methodological diversity, and contrasting perspectives on memory

reconsolidation in therapy. In total, 934 papers were identified, 313 were screened, 223 were deemed eligible, and
the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1 Mechanisms of Memory Reconsolidation

Reconsolidation is triggered when a consolidated memory is reactivated, rendering it temporarily labile and open to

modification before restabilization (Lee et al., 2017; Elsey et al., 2018; Elsey & Kindt, 2017; Nader, 2015; Chen et al.,

2025). This process is dependent on protein synthesis and involves key brain regions such as the amygdala,

hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (Drexler & Wolf, 2017; Wideman et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2025).

Neurotransmitter systems, including glutamate, dopamine, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine, play critical roles in

both destabilization and restabilization phases (Wideman et al., 2018; Papalini et al., 2020; Drexler & Wolf, 2017).

Prediction error—when there is a mismatch between expected and actual outcomes during memory retrieval—is a

crucial trigger for reconsolidation, allowing for memory updating or disruption (Sinclair & Barense, 2019; Ecker,

2021; Chen et al., 2025).

3.2 Necessary Conditions and Boundary Factors

Not all memories are equally susceptible to reconsolidation. Boundary conditions include memory age, strength,

and the nature of the reactivation procedure (Elsey & Kindt, 2017; Treanor et al., 2017; Bolsoni & Zuardi, 2019;

Sinclair & Barense, 2019; Wideman et al., 2018). Stronger or older memories, such as those underlying chronic

PTSD or addiction, may be more resistant to reconsolidation, though certain protocols can overcome these barriers

(Elsey & Kindt, 2017; Silva & Gräff, 2023; Chen et al., 2025). The presence of prediction error during retrieval is
often necessary to induce lability (Sinclair & Barense, 2019; Ecker, 2021). The timing and duration of the

reconsolidation window (typically a few hours post-reactivation) are critical for effective intervention, especially for
pharmacological approaches (Bolsoni & Zuardi, 2019; Chen et al., 2025).

3.3 Therapeutic Applications and Interventions

Reconsolidation-based interventions have been explored in various clinical contexts, including PTSD, substance

use disorders, and depression (Huang et al., 2024; Feduccia & Mithoefer, 2018; Milton, 2023; Meister et al., 2023;
Farrell & Mahood, 2022; Fattore et al., 2018; Barak & Goltseker, 2023; Williams et al., 2025; Köhler et al., 2015;

Luoma et al., 2021; Kida, 2018; Brewin, 2018; Ross et al., 2017). Both behavioral (e.g., retrieval-extinction, memory

updating protocols) and pharmacological (e.g., propranolol, ketamine, MDMA) strategies have shown promise in
modifying maladaptive memories (Huang et al., 2024; Feduccia & Mithoefer, 2018; Meister et al., 2023; Fattore et

al., 2018; Barak & Goltseker, 2023; Williams et al., 2025; Fattore et al., 2017; Luoma et al., 2021). However, results

are mixed, with some studies reporting robust and lasting symptom reduction, while others find limited or no

effect, highlighting the importance of protocol specifics and individual differences (Meister et al., 2023; Farrell &
Mahood, 2022; Ecker, 2021; Drexler & Wolf, 2018; Phelps & Hofmann, 2019).

3.4 Methodological and Translational Challenges

There is significant methodological heterogeneity in reconsolidation research, including variability in memory

types, reactivation procedures, and outcome measures (Treanor et al., 2017; Elsey et al., 2018; Barak & Goltseker,

2021; Barak & Goltseker, 2023; Ecker, 2021; Drexler & Wolf, 2018; Phelps & Hofmann, 2019). Replication failures and
inconsistent findings are common, often attributable to differences in prediction error induction, memory

characteristics, and intervention timing (Ecker, 2021; Drexler & Wolf, 2018; Phelps & Hofmann, 2019). Translating

laboratory protocols to clinical practice remains challenging, and more standardized, systematic research is needed
(Treanor et al., 2017; Barak & Goltseker, 2021; Barak & Goltseker, 2023; Ecker, 2021; Phelps & Hofmann, 2019;

Gisquet-Verrier & Riccio, 2018).

4. Discussion

The research on memory reconsolidation in a therapeutic context reveals both significant promise and notable

challenges. Mechanistically, reconsolidation offers a unique window for modifying maladaptive memories, with

prediction error and memory reactivation as key triggers (Lee et al., 2017; Sinclair & Barense, 2019; Ecker, 2021;

Chen et al., 2025). The involvement of specific neurotransmitter systems and brain regions underscores the

biological plausibility of targeting reconsolidation for clinical benefit (Drexler & Wolf, 2017; Wideman et al., 2018;

Papalini et al., 2020). However, the necessary conditions for reliably inducing reconsolidation—such as memory
age, strength, and the precise nature of retrieval—are not always met in clinical populations, limiting the

generalizability of laboratory findings (Elsey & Kindt, 2017; Treanor et al., 2017; Bolsoni & Zuardi, 2019; Sinclair &

Barense, 2019; Wideman et al., 2018; Silva & Gräff, 2023).

Therapeutic interventions leveraging reconsolidation have shown efficacy in some studies, particularly when

protocols are carefully designed to induce prediction error and target the reconsolidation window (Huang et al.,

2024; Feduccia & Mithoefer, 2018; Milton, 2023; Meister et al., 2023; Fattore et al., 2018; Barak & Goltseker, 2023;

Williams et al., 2025; Fattore et al., 2017; Luoma et al., 2021). Yet, mixed results and replication failures highlight the

need for greater methodological rigor and standardization (Treanor et al., 2017; Barak & Goltseker, 2021; Barak &

Goltseker, 2023; Ecker, 2021; Drexler & Wolf, 2018; Phelps & Hofmann, 2019; Gisquet-Verrier & Riccio, 2018). The
field is also grappling with alternative models, such as memory integration, and the challenge of distinguishing

reconsolidation from extinction and other memory processes (Gisquet-Verrier & Riccio, 2018; Chen et al., 2025;

Taylor et al., 2009; Barak & Goltseker, 2021).

5. Conclusion

Memory reconsolidation represents a promising mechanism for therapeutic modification of maladaptive memories,
with strong mechanistic support and growing clinical evidence. However, reliably inducing reconsolidation in

therapy requires careful attention to necessary conditions such as prediction error, memory characteristics, and

intervention timing. Methodological variability and boundary conditions remain significant challenges for clinical

translation.

5.1 Research Gaps
