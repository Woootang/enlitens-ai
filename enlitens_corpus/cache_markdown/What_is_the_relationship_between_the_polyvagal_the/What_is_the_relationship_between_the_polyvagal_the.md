The Relationship Between Polyvagal Theory, Neuroception, and Therapeutic
Presence

1. Introduction

The relationship between polyvagal theory, neuroception, and therapeutic presence is central to understanding

how safety and connection are established in therapeutic relationships. Polyvagal theory, developed by Stephen

Porges, describes how the autonomic nervous system (ANS) supports social engagement and emotional regulation

through hierarchical neural circuits, particularly the ventral vagal complex. Neuroception refers to the subconscious

neural process by which the nervous system detects cues of safety, danger, or life threat, influencing physiological

and behavioral responses without conscious awareness. Therapeutic presence involves the therapist’s attunement

and engagement, creating an environment where both client and therapist can experience a felt sense of safety,

which is foundational for effective therapy. The integration of these concepts suggests that therapeutic presence can

trigger neuroception of safety, activating the social engagement system and downregulating defensive responses,

thereby facilitating deeper therapeutic work and co-regulation between therapist and client (Geller & Porges, 2014;

Schroeter, 2016; Porges, 2025; Fox, 2025; Sanders & Hall, 2017; Cogan et al., 2025; Sullivan et al., 2018; Morton et al.,

2021; Porges, 2003; Porges, 2011). This framework has been applied across diverse clinical contexts, including

trauma, attachment, and emotion regulation, and is supported by emerging psychometric tools and clinical

interventions (Geller & Porges, 2014; Porges, 2025; Cogan et al., 2025; Morton et al., 2021; Porges, 2003; Flores &

Porges, 2017; Roche et al., 2025).

2. Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including
databases such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy involved 20 targeted queries grouped into 8
thematic clusters, focusing on foundational concepts, neurophysiological mechanisms, clinical applications, critiques,
and adjacent fields. In total, 1,011 papers were identified, 547 were screened, 386 were deemed eligible, and the top

50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1. Polyvagal Theory: Foundations and Mechanisms

Polyvagal theory posits a hierarchical organization of the ANS, with the ventral vagal complex supporting social

engagement and safety, and the dorsal vagal and sympathetic systems mediating defensive responses. The theory

emphasizes the role of the vagus nerve in regulating physiological states that underlie social behavior, emotional

resilience, and adaptive responses (Schroeter, 2016; Hanazawa, 2022; Porges, 2025; Sullivan et al., 2018; Porges,

2003; Porges, 2011; Neuhuber & Berthoud, 2022).

3.2. Neuroception: The Detection of Safety and Threat

Neuroception is the subconscious process by which the nervous system evaluates environmental cues for safety or

danger, influencing autonomic state shifts. This process is central to polyvagal theory and is critical for understanding

how individuals respond to therapeutic environments and relationships (Geller & Porges, 2014; Hanazawa, 2022;

Porges, 2025; Cogan et al., 2025; Morton et al., 2021; Porges, 2003; Poli & Miccoli, 2024; Roche et al., 2025).

3.3. Therapeutic Presence and the Social Engagement System

Therapeutic presence involves the therapist’s full engagement and attunement, which can signal safety to the client

through nonverbal cues (e.g., facial expression, vocal prosody). This presence is theorized to activate the client’s
social engagement system via neuroception, facilitating co-regulation, trust, and optimal conditions for therapeutic
change (Geller & Porges, 2014; Fox, 2025; Sanders & Hall, 2017; Ryland et al., 2021; Sullivan et al., 2018; Morton et al.,

2021; Porges, 2003; Flores & Porges, 2017; Bernards, 2017; (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) & (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0), 2017).

3.4. Clinical Applications and Measurement

Polyvagal-informed interventions are increasingly used in trauma therapy, attachment work, and creative arts
therapies, emphasizing the importance of fostering safety and co-regulation. Tools such as the Neuroception of

Psychological Safety Scale (NPSS) have been developed to measure the felt sense of safety in clinical and research

settings (Cogan et al., 2025; Morton et al., 2021; Poli & Miccoli, 2024; Roche et al., 2025; Lans et al., 2025).

4. Discussion

The literature strongly supports a synergistic relationship between polyvagal theory, neuroception, and therapeutic

presence. Polyvagal theory provides a neurophysiological framework for understanding how safety is established in

therapeutic relationships, with neuroception acting as the mechanism by which safety is detected and therapeutic

presence serving as the relational context that facilitates this process (Geller & Porges, 2014; Porges, 2025; Cogan et

al., 2025; Morton et al., 2021; Porges, 2003; Porges, 2011; Flores & Porges, 2017). The activation of the social

engagement system through therapeutic presence can downregulate defensive responses, enabling deeper

therapeutic work and co-regulation (Geller & Porges, 2014; Fox, 2025; Sanders & Hall, 2017; Ryland et al., 2021;

Sullivan et al., 2018; Porges, 2003; Flores & Porges, 2017; Bernards, 2017; (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) & (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0), 2017). Measurement tools like the

NPSS offer empirical support for these concepts, linking subjective experiences of safety to observable outcomes in

therapy (Cogan et al., 2025; Morton et al., 2021; Poli & Miccoli, 2024; Roche et al., 2025).

However, some critiques highlight the need for further empirical validation of polyvagal theory’s anatomical

specificity and its application across diverse populations (Porges, 2025; Neuhuber & Berthoud, 2022; Lans et al.,

2025). Despite these debates, the theory’s clinical utility in trauma, attachment, and emotion regulation is widely

recognized (Porges, 2025; Sanders & Hall, 2017; Sullivan et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2023; Porges, 2003; Flores &

Porges, 2017; Roche et al., 2025; Lans et al., 2025).

5. Conclusion

The relationship between polyvagal theory, neuroception, and therapeutic presence is well-supported by both

theoretical and empirical literature. Therapeutic presence, informed by polyvagal theory, can activate neuroception
of safety, facilitating co-regulation and optimal conditions for therapeutic change. While the framework is widely
applied and supported, further research is needed to address ongoing debates and expand empirical validation,
especially in diverse clinical contexts.
