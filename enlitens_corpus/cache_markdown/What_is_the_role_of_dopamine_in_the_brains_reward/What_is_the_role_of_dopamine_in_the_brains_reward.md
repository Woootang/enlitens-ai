Yes, dopamine in the brain's reward system is central to learning, motivation, and
belief updating during persuasion by signaling reward prediction errors and
guiding which information is relevant for updating beliefs.

1. Introduction

Dopamine is a key neuromodulator in the brain's reward system, playing a pivotal role in reinforcement learning,

motivation, and the updating of beliefs in response to persuasive information. Traditionally, dopamine has been

viewed as a signal for reward, but recent research highlights its broader function as a teaching signal that indicates

which information is relevant for learning and belief updating, especially in social and persuasive contexts (Schuster

& Lamm, 2024; Babayan et al., 2018; Lerner et al., 2020; Schultz, 1998; Schultz, 2016; Gershman & Uchida, 2019;

Schultz, 2019; Nour et al., 2018; Schultz, 2013; Starkweather et al., 2017; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016). Dopamine

neurons, particularly in the midbrain, encode reward prediction errors (RPEs)—the difference between expected

and received outcomes—which drive learning and adaptive behavior (Lerner et al., 2020; Schultz, 1998; Schultz,

2016; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Schultz, 2019; Schultz, 2013; Starkweather et al., 2017; Schultz, 2016; Schultz,

1997; Lak et al., 2016). This mechanism is not limited to tangible rewards but extends to social learning, trust, and

belief revision, making dopamine central to how individuals respond to persuasive messages and update their

beliefs accordingly (Schuster & Lamm, 2024; Babayan et al., 2018; Seitz et al., 2019; Gershman & Uchida, 2019;

Nour et al., 2018; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016). The dopamine system's influence is evident across various brain

regions, including the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and limbic structures, and is modulated by both phasic (rapid,
event-related) and tonic (sustained) dopamine release (Wise, 2004; Mohebi et al., 2019; Berke, 2018; Baik, 2020;

Schultz, 2019; Schultz, 2013; Bamford et al., 2018; Corkrum et al., 2020). This review synthesizes current findings on

dopamine's role in the reward system during persuasion and belief updating, integrating insights from

computational, neurophysiological, and behavioral studies.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across more than 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search targeted dopamine's role in the reward system,

persuasion, and belief updating, using both foundational and interdisciplinary queries. In total, 1,038 papers were

identified, 607 were screened, 402 were deemed eligible, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this
review.

3. Results

3.1. Dopamine as a Reward Prediction Error Signal

Dopamine neurons encode reward prediction errors (RPEs)—the difference between expected and actual
outcomes—which serve as a teaching signal for learning and belief updating (Lerner et al., 2020; Schultz, 1998;

Schultz, 2016; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Schultz, 2019; Schultz, 2013; Starkweather et al., 2017; Schultz, 2016;

Schultz, 1997; Lak et al., 2016). This RPE mechanism is central to reinforcement learning and underlies the updating
of beliefs in response to new, persuasive information (Babayan et al., 2018; Lerner et al., 2020; Schultz, 2016;

Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Schultz, 2019; Schultz, 2013; Starkweather et al., 2017; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016).

3.2. Dopamine and Social/Trust Learning

Recent research extends dopamine's role beyond simple reward to social learning, trust, and belief updating in

interpersonal contexts (Schuster & Lamm, 2024; Seitz et al., 2019; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Nour et al., 2018;
Schwartenbeck et al., 2016). Dopamine signals help determine which social information is relevant for updating

trust beliefs and adapting to persuasive messages (Schuster & Lamm, 2024; Seitz et al., 2019; Nour et al., 2018;

Schwartenbeck et al., 2016).

2 / 9

3.3. Dopamine, Motivation, and Attention

Dopamine modulates motivation and the allocation of cognitive resources, influencing how much effort is invested

in processing persuasive information and updating beliefs (Wise, 2004; Mohebi et al., 2019; Berke, 2018; Baik,
2020; Walton & Bouret, 2019; Schultz, 2019; Schultz, 2013; Bamford et al., 2018; Corkrum et al., 2020; Westbrook &

Braver, 2016). Both phasic and tonic dopamine release contribute to motivation, attention, and the salience of cues

associated with rewards or persuasive messages (Mohebi et al., 2019; Berke, 2018; Baik, 2020; Schultz, 2019;
Schultz, 2013; Bamford et al., 2018; Corkrum et al., 2020; Westbrook & Braver, 2016).

3.4. Dopamine and Belief State Representation

Dopamine activity reflects not only reward value but also belief states and uncertainty, supporting Bayesian models

of belief updating (Babayan et al., 2018; Seitz et al., 2019; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Nour et al., 2018; Starkweather

et al., 2017; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016). Dopamine-rich midbrain regions encode shifts in beliefs, and the

magnitude of dopamine responses predicts behavioral changes in belief updating tasks (Babayan et al., 2018; Seitz
et al., 2019; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Nour et al., 2018; Starkweather et al., 2017; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016).

4. Discussion

The evidence robustly supports dopamine's central role in the brain's reward system for learning, motivation, and

belief updating during persuasion. Dopamine neurons encode reward prediction errors, which serve as a teaching

signal for updating beliefs and guiding adaptive behavior (Lerner et al., 2020; Schultz, 1998; Schultz, 2016;

Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Schultz, 2019; Schultz, 2013; Starkweather et al., 2017; Schultz, 2016; Schultz, 1997; Lak

et al., 2016). This mechanism extends to social and trust learning, where dopamine signals help determine which
information is relevant for updating beliefs about others and responding to persuasive messages (Schuster &

Lamm, 2024; Seitz et al., 2019; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Nour et al., 2018; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016). Dopamine

also modulates motivation and attention, influencing the effort invested in processing persuasive information

(Wise, 2004; Mohebi et al., 2019; Berke, 2018; Baik, 2020; Walton & Bouret, 2019; Schultz, 2019; Schultz, 2013;

Bamford et al., 2018; Corkrum et al., 2020; Westbrook & Braver, 2016). Recent computational and neuroimaging

studies show that dopamine activity reflects belief states and uncertainty, supporting Bayesian models of belief

updating (Babayan et al., 2018; Seitz et al., 2019; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Nour et al., 2018; Starkweather et al.,
2017; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016). However, the field is evolving, with ongoing debates about the diversity of

dopamine neuron functions, the integration of motivational and learning signals, and the precise mechanisms by

which dopamine influences belief updating in complex social contexts (Schuster & Lamm, 2024; Lerner et al.,

2020; Gershman & Uchida, 2019; Schultz, 2019; Nour et al., 2018; Schwartenbeck et al., 2016).

5.2. Open Research Questions

Future research should address the following questions to advance understanding of dopamine's role in persuasion

and belief updating:

Question

Why

How does dopamine-mediated belief updating
operate in real-world persuasive contexts?

Laboratory tasks may not capture the complexity of
belief change in everyday social and persuasive

situations.

What are the distinct roles of dopamine neuron

Understanding circuit specificity can clarify how

subpopulations in motivation versus learning during
persuasion?

dopamine supports different aspects of persuasion and
belief updating.

How do dopamine signals interact with other
neuromodulators in belief updating and persuasion?

Other neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, acetylcholine)
may modulate or complement dopamine's effects.

FIGURE  Open research questions for future studies on dopamine and belief updating during persuasion.

In summary, dopamine is essential for learning, motivation, and belief updating during persuasion, but further

research is needed to clarify its diverse functions, circuit specificity, and real-world relevance.
