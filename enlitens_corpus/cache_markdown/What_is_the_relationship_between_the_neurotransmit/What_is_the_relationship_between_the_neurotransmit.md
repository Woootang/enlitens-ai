Yes, oxytocin is associated with increased trust in a communicator, but its effects
are context-dependent and influenced by individual and social factors.

1. Introduction

Oxytocin, a neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus, has been widely studied for its role in social bonding,

cooperation, and trust. Early influential studies suggested that oxytocin directly increases interpersonal trust,

including trust in communicators and message sources, by promoting prosocial behaviors and reducing social

anxiety (Zak et al., 2005; Kosfeld et al., 2005; Zak et al., 2004; Baumgartner et al., 2008; Van IJzendoorn &
Bakermans‐Kranenburg, 2012; Kirsch, 2015). However, more recent research and meta-analyses indicate that the
relationship is complex: oxytocin’s effects on trust are highly context-dependent, moderated by factors such as

group membership, perceived trustworthiness, individual differences (e.g., gender, attachment style, psychiatric

status), and even the nature of the social interaction (Dreu & Kret, 2016; Yan & Kirsch, 2021; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-

Akel, 2016; Bartz et al., 2011; Kret & De Dreu, 2017; Schiller et al., 2023; Venta et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021; Xu et al.,

2019; Ide et al., 2018; Shou et al., 2022; Leng et al., 2022; Merolla et al., 2013). While oxytocin can enhance trust

and conformity toward in-group members or trusted communicators, it may have neutral or even negative effects

in other contexts, such as with out-group members or in individuals with certain psychiatric conditions (Dreu &

Kret, 2016; Bartz et al., 2011; Kret & De Dreu, 2017; Venta et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Ide et al., 2018). This review

synthesizes the evidence on oxytocin’s role in modulating trust in communicators, highlighting both its potential

and its limitations.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across more than 170 million research papers in Consensus, including
Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search targeted oxytocin’s relationship with trust in

communicators, using both foundational and context-specific queries. In total, 1,038 papers were identified, 473

were screened, 328 were deemed eligible, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. Oxytocin and Trust: Foundational Evidence

Initial studies using economic trust games and intranasal oxytocin administration found that oxytocin increases

trust in strangers and communicators, independent of risk-taking (Zak et al., 2005; Kosfeld et al., 2005; Zak et al.,
2004; Baumgartner et al., 2008; Van IJzendoorn & Bakermans‐Kranenburg, 2012; Kirsch, 2015). Higher endogenous
oxytocin levels are also associated with more trustworthy and trusting behavior in social exchanges (Zak et al.,

2004; Zak et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2012).

3.2. Contextual and Individual Moderators

Subsequent research revealed that oxytocin’s trust-enhancing effects are context-dependent. Oxytocin increases

trust and conformity toward in-group members and trusted communicators, but may not increase (and can even

decrease) trust toward out-group members or in ambiguous situations (Dreu & Kret, 2016; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-
Akel, 2016; Kret & De Dreu, 2017; Schiller et al., 2023; Van IJzendoorn & Bakermans‐Kranenburg, 2012; Xu et al.,
2019; Ide et al., 2018; Merolla et al., 2013). Individual factors such as gender, attachment style, psychiatric status,

and oxytocin receptor gene variants further moderate these effects (Bartz et al., 2011; Schiller et al., 2023; Venta et
al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2015; Shou et al., 2022).

3.3. Mechanisms: Social Salience and Anxiety Reduction

The “social salience hypothesis” posits that oxytocin enhances the salience of social cues, making individuals more
attuned to communicators’ intentions and group membership (Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016; Menon &

Neumann, 2023; Yao & Kendrick, 2025). Oxytocin may also reduce social anxiety and fear of betrayal, facilitating

trust in communicators perceived as safe or familiar (Baumgartner et al., 2008; Kirsch, 2015; Shou et al., 2022).

3.4. Limitations, Replication Issues, and Paradoxical Effects

Recent meta-analyses and large-scale replications have failed to consistently reproduce the original strong effects
of oxytocin on trust, suggesting that the effect is smaller and more variable than initially thought (Yan & Kirsch,

2021; Nave et al., 2015; Declerck et al., 2020; Lane et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2019; Ide et al., 2018; Leng et al., 2022). In

some cases, oxytocin can even decrease trust, especially in individuals with high attachment anxiety or psychiatric
disorders (Bartz et al., 2011; Venta et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Ide et al., 2018). Oxytocin’s effects are also not limited

to trust, but extend to broader prosocial and affiliative behaviors (Yan & Kirsch, 2021; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel,

2016; Yang et al., 2021; Menon & Neumann, 2023; Xu et al., 2019; Yao & Kendrick, 2025; Shou et al., 2022; Leng et
al., 2022).

4. Discussion

The evidence supports a nuanced relationship between oxytocin and trust in communicators. While early studies

and some meta-analyses found that oxytocin can increase trust, especially in economic games and in-group

contexts, more recent research highlights the importance of context, individual differences, and social cues (Dreu &

Kret, 2016; Yan & Kirsch, 2021; Zak et al., 2005; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016; Kosfeld et al., 2005; Kret & De
Dreu, 2017; Schiller et al., 2023; Baumgartner et al., 2008; Van IJzendoorn & Bakermans‐Kranenburg, 2012; Xu et al.,
2019; Ide et al., 2018; Kirsch, 2015; Shou et al., 2022; Merolla et al., 2013). Oxytocin appears to enhance the
salience of social information, making individuals more sensitive to the intentions and group membership of

communicators (Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016; Menon & Neumann, 2023; Yao & Kendrick, 2025). This can lead

to increased trust in familiar or in-group communicators, but may have no effect or even reduce trust in out-group

or ambiguous situations (Dreu & Kret, 2016; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016; Kret & De Dreu, 2017; Schiller et al.,
2023; Van IJzendoorn & Bakermans‐Kranenburg, 2012; Xu et al., 2019; Ide et al., 2018; Merolla et al., 2013). The
effect of oxytocin is also moderated by factors such as gender, attachment style, psychiatric status, and genetic

variation (Bartz et al., 2011; Schiller et al., 2023; Venta et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2015; Shou et al.,
2022). Replication failures and null findings suggest that oxytocin’s effect on trust is smaller and more variable than

originally thought, and may be better understood as part of a broader influence on social cognition and prosocial

behavior (Yan & Kirsch, 2021; Nave et al., 2015; Declerck et al., 2020; Lane et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2019; Ide et al.,

2018; Leng et al., 2022).

5. Conclusion

Oxytocin is associated with increased trust in communicators, but its effects are highly context-dependent and

influenced by individual and social factors. It enhances the salience of social cues, promoting trust in familiar or in-
group communicators, but may have neutral or even negative effects in other contexts.

5.2. Open Research Questions

Question

Why

How does oxytocin influence trust in communicators in
real-world, ecologically valid settings?

Laboratory tasks may not capture the complexity
of real-world communication and trust.

What are the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying
individual differences in oxytocin’s trust effects?

Understanding variability can inform targeted
interventions and therapeutic applications.

How do context and group membership interact with
oxytocin to shape trust in communicators?

Social context and group dynamics are key
moderators of oxytocin’s effects.

FIGURE  Open research questions for future studies on oxytocin and trust in communicators.

In summary, oxytocin can increase trust in communicators, especially in-group or familiar individuals, but its effects

are context-dependent, variable, and influenced by individual and social factors.
