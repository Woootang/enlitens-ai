The use of profanity by a speaker generally decreases perceived credibility and
trustworthiness, but context, intent, and audience expectations can lead to mixed or
even positive effects in certain situations.

1. Introduction

The effect of profanity on a speaker’s perceived credibility and trustworthiness is complex and context-dependent. Most

research finds that swearing tends to harm impressions of intelligence, trustworthiness, and overall credibility, especially in

formal or mixed-gender settings (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Hamilton, 1989; König & Jucks, 2019;

Perrault et al., 2021; Westrop et al., 2018). However, some studies show that profanity can enhance perceptions of

authenticity, emotional intensity, and even credibility—particularly when used judiciously, in informal contexts, or to

express strong feelings (Rassin & Van Der Heijden, 2005; Lie et al., 2023; Lafreniere et al., 2022; Fägersten, 2017; Johnson,

2012). The impact of profanity is also shaped by factors such as the speaker’s gender, the relationship between speaker and

audience, the type of profanity, and the expectations or norms of the setting (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al.,

1973; Cavazza & Guidetti, 2014; Rudisel, 2016; Allard & Holmstrom, 2023; Seiter & Johnson, 2024; Johnson & Lewis, 2010;

Johnson, 2012). Thus, while the default effect is negative, there are notable exceptions where swearing can serve as a

strategic tool for connection or emphasis.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic Scholar,
PubMed, and other sources. The search targeted studies on profanity, swearing, speaker credibility, trustworthiness, and
related constructs across communication, psychology, and media studies. In total, 1,015 papers were identified, 723 were

screened, 392 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3.1 General Effects: Profanity Reduces Credibility and Trustworthiness

Most studies report that speakers who use profanity are rated lower in credibility, trustworthiness, intelligence, sociability,

and politeness (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Hamilton, 1989; König & Jucks, 2019; Perrault et al., 2021;

Westrop et al., 2018). This effect is especially pronounced in formal or mixed-gender settings, and when the profanity is

perceived as lewd or aggressive (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Hamilton, 1989; König & Jucks, 2019;

Cavazza & Guidetti, 2014; Perrault et al., 2021; Nau & Stewart, 2018; Martaindale et al., 2022; Johnson & Lewis, 2010).

3.2 Contextual and Moderating Factors

The impact of profanity is moderated by context (formal vs. informal), speaker gender, relationship to the audience, and the

type of profanity used (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Cavazza & Guidetti, 2014; Rudisel, 2016; Allard &

Holmstrom, 2023; Seiter & Johnson, 2024; Johnson & Lewis, 2010; Johnson, 2012). For example, swearing in informal or

peer-group settings can sometimes foster solidarity or reduce social distance (Fägersten, 2017; Fine & Corte, 2024; Debray,

2023; Fägersten & Stapleton, 2023; Johnson, 2012). In online reviews, profanity can increase perceived authenticity and

helpfulness, especially when used sparingly and in low-subjectivity contexts (Lie et al., 2023; Lafreniere et al., 2022).

3.3 Positive and Mixed Effects

Some research finds that judicious or strategic use of profanity can increase perceptions of authenticity, emotional
intensity, and even credibility—particularly when the audience perceives the swearing as genuine or contextually
appropriate (Rassin & Van Der Heijden, 2005; Lie et al., 2023; Feldman et al., 2017; Fägersten, 2017; Lafreniere et al., 2022;
Johnson, 2012). In legal or testimonial contexts, swearing has been shown to increase the believability of statements
(Rassin & Van Der Heijden, 2005). In online and entertainment settings, swearing can help build a relatable persona and

foster audience engagement (Fägersten, 2017; Lafreniere et al., 2022; Fägersten & Stapleton, 2023).

3.4 Risks and Negative Reactions

Profanity is more likely to backfire in professional, academic, or high-stakes contexts, where it is seen as a violation of

norms and can lead to perceptions of incompetence, aggression, or unprofessionalism (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019;
Bostrom et al., 1973; Hamilton, 1989; König & Jucks, 2019; Perrault et al., 2021; Martaindale et al., 2022; Johnson & Lewis,

2010; Westrop et al., 2018). The negative impact is often stronger for women, authority figures, or in cross-gender
interactions (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Cavazza & Guidetti, 2014; Allard & Holmstrom, 2023;

Perrault et al., 2021; Nau & Stewart, 2018).

4. Discussion

The literature overwhelmingly finds that profanity generally reduces a speaker’s perceived credibility and trustworthiness,

especially in formal, professional, or mixed-gender contexts (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Hamilton,

1989; König & Jucks, 2019; Perrault et al., 2021; Westrop et al., 2018). This is likely due to social norms associating swearing
with lack of self-control, aggression, or disrespect (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Hamilton, 1989; König

& Jucks, 2019; Perrault et al., 2021; Martaindale et al., 2022; Johnson & Lewis, 2010). However, the effect is not universal. In

some informal, peer, or online contexts, profanity can signal authenticity, emotional intensity, or solidarity, and may even

enhance credibility or helpfulness when used judiciously (Rassin & Van Der Heijden, 2005; Lie et al., 2023; Fägersten, 2017;

Lafreniere et al., 2022; Johnson, 2012). The impact of profanity is thus highly context-dependent, shaped by audience
expectations, relationship dynamics, and the perceived intent behind the language (Stapleton, 2020; Lie et al., 2023;

Fägersten, 2017; Lafreniere et al., 2022; Stapleton & Fägersten, 2023; Debray, 2023; Fägersten & Stapleton, 2023; Johnson,

2012).

Notably, the strategic use of mild profanity can sometimes increase the believability of statements or foster a sense of
intimacy and relatability, particularly in entertainment or digital media (Rassin & Van Der Heijden, 2005; Lie et al., 2023;

Fägersten, 2017; Lafreniere et al., 2022; Fägersten & Stapleton, 2023; Johnson, 2012). However, excessive, aggressive, or

contextually inappropriate swearing almost always backfires, leading to negative judgments of competence,

trustworthiness, and professionalism (DeFrank & Kahlbaugh, 2019; Bostrom et al., 1973; Hamilton, 1989; König & Jucks,
2019; Perrault et al., 2021; Martaindale et al., 2022; Johnson & Lewis, 2010; Westrop et al., 2018).

5. Conclusion

Profanity typically reduces a speaker’s perceived credibility and trustworthiness, especially in formal or professional

contexts, but can sometimes enhance authenticity, emotional intensity, or relatability in informal or peer-group settings.

The effect is highly context-dependent and moderated by audience expectations, relationship dynamics, and the intent

behind the language.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite robust findings, gaps remain in understanding the nuanced effects of profanity across cultures, digital platforms,

and diverse audiences. More research is needed on the long-term impact of strategic swearing, the role of intent, and the
effects in multicultural or multilingual contexts.

authenticity or relatability in the right context, making its effects highly dependent on situational and relational factors.
