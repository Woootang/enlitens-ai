DOCUMENT SUMMARY This genetic research study provides powerful evidence that common 
risk alleles for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show widespread signatures of positive 
evolutionary selection. The authors hypothesize this is because these same genes are linked to 
enhanced cognitive abilities, neurogenesis, and brain development. This directly supports the 
Enlitens view that neurodivergence is an evolutionary advantage, reframing ASD not as a 
simple defect but as a trait with beneficial aspects that has been actively selected for in human 
history.

Widespread signatures of positive 
selection in common risk alleles 
associated to autism spectrum disorder

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper provides foundational scientific evidence for our core belief that neurodivergent traits
are evolutionary advantages, not pathologies. It uses complex genetic analysis to argue that the
very genes that increase the likelihood of an autism diagnosis have been actively selected for 
during human evolution because of their connection to higher intelligence and brain 
development.

This directly challenges the medical model's view of autism as purely a "disorder." It allows us to
reframe the conversation with clients, parents, and other professionals, grounding our 
neurodiversity-affirming stance in evolutionary science. The paper explains the prevalence of 
autism not as a failure of nature, but as the "evolutionary cost" of selecting for enhanced 
cognitive skills in the human population—a powerful concept for our whitepapers, assessments, 
and advocacy.

Critical Statistics for Our Work

● Correlation with Positive Selection: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) GWAS 
results are positively correlated with signatures of incomplete positive 
selection (p=3.53∗10−4).

● Increased Probability of Selection: Genetic variants associated with ASD (GWAS
p<0.1) have a 19% increased probability of being in the top 5% of genomic 
regions showing positive selection (Odds Ratio = 1.19, p=9.56∗10−7).

● Genetic Correlation with Intelligence/Education: ASD genetics shows a strong 

positive correlation with several advantageous traits:

○ Years of schooling (

rg=0.277,p=2.9∗10−13)

○ College completion (

rg=0.339,p=1∗10−6)
○ Childhood intelligence (

rg=0.425,p=5.74∗10−5)

● ASD Prevalence: A 2012 CDC report noted an ASD prevalence of 1.47% in the US 

population, or 1 in 68 children.

● Heritability of ASD: Common genetic variation accounts for 49% of ASD heritability, 

while inherited rare and de novo mutations account for only 6%.

Methodology We Can Learn From

The study used a purely computational and statistical methodology, which, while not directly 
replicable in our clinical practice, provides the basis for its powerful conclusions. The authors 
analyzed large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics from the 
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for five psychiatric conditions, including ASD.

They used a machine-learning algorithm called Hierarchical Boosting (HB) to identify genomic 
regions that showed signatures of positive selection in a European population dataset. By cross-
referencing the locations of ASD-associated genetic variants with these signatures of selection, 
they were able to test the hypothesis that ASD risk alleles have been evolutionarily 
advantageous. This approach of combining large datasets to uncover patterns that challenge 
existing paradigms is philosophically aligned with the Enlitens mission.

Findings That Challenge the System

The study's primary finding is a direct challenge to the simple "disorder" model of autism. It 
suggests a dual mechanism for autism genetics that explains why it persists at a relatively high 
rate in the population.

1. Rare, Damaging Mutations are Selected Against: The paper acknowledges that rare, 
disruptive genetic mutations that can cause autism are under "purifying selection," 
meaning evolution actively tries to remove them. This aligns with the traditional view of a
genetic disorder.

2. Common, Risk Alleles are Selected For: In contrast, the much more common 

polygenic variants that contribute to autism risk are under positive selection. These are 
not "bad" genes; they are genes that, on average, confer an advantage, likely related to 
cognitive ability. An individual developing autism can be seen as the "evolutionary cost" 
of a species-level adaptation for higher intelligence.

This complex picture shatters the black-and-white view of "autism genes" as being defective. It 
suggests that the genetic liability for autism is intricately linked with the genetic architecture of 
uniquely human cognitive strengths.

Populations Discussed

The genetic analysis was conducted using GWAS summary statistics and selection scores 
calculated for a

European (CEU) population from the 1,000 Genomes Project. The findings are therefore most 
directly applicable to individuals of European ancestry, and further research would be needed to
confirm these specific signatures in other global populations.

Alternative Approaches Mentioned

This entire paper represents an alternative framework for understanding the persistence of 
autism. Rather than viewing it solely through a medical/pathological lens, it applies the 
principles of evolutionary biology and population genetics.

● Polygenic Adaptation: The study frames ASD as a potential outcome of "polygenic 

adaptation," where subtle changes in the frequency of many different genes, each with a
small effect, combine to produce an adaptive trait (like higher cognition) in the 
population.

● Evolutionary Cost Hypothesis: The paper's conclusion—that autism's prevalence is an

evolutionary trade-off for enhanced cognitive abilities in the human species—is a 
powerful alternative explanation that moves beyond simple deficit-based models.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the core hypothesis: "Accordingly, we hypothesize that certain ASD risk alleles 
were under positive selection during human evolution due to their involvement in 
neurogenesis and cognitive ability."

● On the dual nature of ASD genetics: "at least two different evolutionary mechanisms 
appear to be present in relation to ASD genetics: 1) rare disruptive alleles eliminated by 
purifying selection; 2) common alleles selected for their beneficial effects on cognitive 
skills."

● On explaining ASD prevalence: "This scenario would explain ASD prevalence, which 
is higher than that expected for a trait under purifying selection, as the evolutionary cost 
of polygenic adaptation related to cognitive ability."

● Connecting autism to high intelligence: "multiple forms of evidence support that 

autism and high intelligence quotient share a diverse set of correlates, such as large 
brain size, fast brain growth, increased sensory and visual-spatial abilities, enhanced 
synaptic functions, increased attentional focus, high socioeconomic status, more 
deliberative decision-making, and high levels of positive assortative mating"

● On the role of common variants: "Conversely, genetic predisposition to ASD due to 
common variants is highly polygenic and, taken together on a population level, these 
alleles present beneficial effects with respect to cognitive ability."

● The overall conclusion: "In conclusion, the present study provides evidence regarding 

the role of human evolution in shaping the genetic architecture of psychiatry disorders, 
providing a hypothesis to explain the ASD prevalence as the evolutionary cost of the 
polygenic adaptation of the disease risk alleles."

Clinical Implications

The clinical implications of this research are primarily in how we frame and understand autism.

1. Reframing for Clients and Parents: This study provides a scientific basis for a 

strengths-based perspective. We can explain that the genetic factors contributing to 
autism are not just "defects" but are linked to evolutionary advantages in human 
cognition. This can reduce stigma and self-blame, fostering a more positive identity.
2. Explaining Prevalence: The "evolutionary cost" hypothesis gives a coherent, non-

pathologizing explanation for why autism exists. It helps answer the "why" question in a 
way that is empowering, suggesting that the traits are a natural and expected part of 
human diversity that has been beneficial to our species as a whole.

3. Connecting to Strengths: The documented genetic correlation between ASD and traits 
like childhood intelligence, college completion, and years of schooling provides strong 
evidence to support our focus on identifying and building upon the cognitive strengths of 
our autistic clients. It shows that the connection between autism and high ability is not 
just anecdotal but has a biological basis.
