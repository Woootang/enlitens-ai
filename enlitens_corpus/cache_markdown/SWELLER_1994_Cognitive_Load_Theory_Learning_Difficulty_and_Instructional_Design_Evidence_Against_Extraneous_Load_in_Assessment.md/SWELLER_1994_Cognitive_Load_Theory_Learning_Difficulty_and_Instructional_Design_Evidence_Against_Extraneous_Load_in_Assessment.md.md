DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This foundational paper by John Sweller (1994) details Cognitive Load Theory, explaining that 
learning difficulty is determined by the interplay between the inherent complexity of information 
(intrinsic load) and the way it is presented (extraneous load). This is a core document for 
Enlitens' mission, as it provides the scientific framework to critique standardized assessments, 
which frequently impose high extraneous cognitive load through confusing formats, irrelevant 
mental processes, and reliance on limited working memory. Sweller's theory validates Enlitens' 
approach by demonstrating that effective instruction—and by extension, effective assessment—
must be designed to minimize extraneous load, thereby allowing an individual's cognitive 
resources to be focused on the actual task of understanding and communicating, which is the 
exact goal of the Enlitens Interview.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "It is pointed out that cognitive load theory deals with learning and problem solving 

difficulty that is artificial in that it can be manipulated by instructional design."

● "In contrast, in different areas, if elements can be learned successively rather than 
simultaneously because they do not interact, intrinsic cognitive load will be low."
● "It is suggested that extraneous cognitive load that interferes with learning only is a 

problem under conditions of high cognitive load caused by high element interactivity."
● "In other cases, two tasks may appear to have roughly similar amounts of 

information but differ enormously in the effort required to achiev、mastery."

● "Both [schema acquisition and automation] have the effect of substantially reducing 

working memory load."

● "The theory suggests that instructional techniques that require students to engage in 

activities that are not directed at schema acquisition and automation, frequently assume 
a processing capacity greater than our limits and so are likely to be defective."

● "According to cognitive load theory, engaging in complex activities such as these that 

impose a heavy cognitive load and are irrelevant to schema acquisition will interfere with
learning."

● "Extraneous cognitive load, by definition, is entirely under instructional control. It can be 

varied by varying the manner in which information is presented and the activities 
required of students."

● "Learning will be difficult if cognitive load is high, irrespective of its source."
● "Material may be difficult to understand if it incorporates a high level of element 

interactivity."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Working Memory Limits: In contrast to a huge long-term memory, working memory is 
very limited and can store and process no more than a few discrete items at any given 
time, a concept established by Miller (1956).

● Expert Schemas: In intellectually complex areas, experts have acquired tens of 

thousands of schemas which act as the building blocks of their intellectual skill. This was
estimated by Simon and Gilmartin (1973).

● Worked Example Effectiveness: A study by Zhu and Simon (1987) found that a three-
year mathematics course was completed in two years by emphasizing worked examples
rather than conventional instruction.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Core Learning Mechanisms

● Schema Acquisition: "A schema is a cognitive construct that organizes the elements of 

information according to the manner with which they will be dealt." Schemas allow 
people to categorize problems and information, enabling them to handle an infinite 
variety of specific instances (like different trees or algebra problems) with a single mental
model. Schema acquisition is a primary mechanism of learning.

● Automation of Intellectual Operations: This is the transfer of learned procedures from 

controlled to automatic processing. When a skill is first learned, using it requires 
conscious attention and effort (controlled processing). With practice, the skill becomes 
automatic, requiring minimal conscious thought and freeing up cognitive resources for 
other activities. Without automation, performance is slow, clumsy, and error-prone.

The Function of Learning in Relation to Working Memory

"The two learning mechanisms discussed above, schema acquisition and automation, share 
one intriguing characteristic. Both have the effect of substantially reducing working memory 
load. It has been known since Miller (1956) that in contrast to a huge long-term memory, 
working memory is very limited. Working memory can store and process no more than a few 

discrete items at any given time. A major function of schema acquisition and automation may be
to ameliorate or even by-pass this restriction.

Schemas effectively increase the amount of information that can be held in working memory by 
chunking individual elements into a single element. ... In this sense, while the number of items 
held in working memory may be very limited, thanks to schemas, the amount of information held
in working memory may be quite large and this may be one of the functions of schema 
acquisition.

Automation also has a significant effect on working memory. It permits working memory to be 
by-passed. Processing that occurs automatically requires less working memory space and as a 
consequence, capacity is freed for other functions. In this sense, automation, like schema 
acquisition, may have a primary function of circumventing limited processing capacity."

Cognitive Load Theory and Instructional Design

"The theory suggests that instructional techniques that require students to engage in activities 
that are not directed at schema acquisition and automation, frequently assume a processing 
capacity greater than our limits and so are likely to be defective. ... According to cognitive load 
theory, engaging in complex activities such as these that impose a heavy cognitive load and are
irrelevant to schema acquisition will interfere with learning."

● The Split-Attention Effect: When learners must mentally integrate disparate sources of 
information (like a diagram and a separate block of text), the act of integration itself 
requires cognitive resources, imposing an extraneous cognitive load. Physically 
integrating the information (e.g., putting labels directly on the diagram) reduces this load 
and facilitates learning.

● The Redundancy Effect: If information is presented in a self-explanatory format (e.g., a 
fully labeled diagram) and is accompanied by redundant text that explains the same 
thing, processing the redundant text imposes an extraneous cognitive load. In this case, 
extraneous load is reduced by
 eliminating the redundant text, not integrating it.

Intrinsic vs. Extraneous Cognitive Load

"Cognitive load imposed by instructional material can be partitioned into that which is due to the 
intrinsic complexity of the core information and that which is a function of the cognitive activities 
required of students because of the manner in which the information is presented. ... total 
cognitive load is an amalgam of at least two quite separate factors: extraneous cognitive load 
which is artificial because it is imposed by instructional methods and intrinsic cognitive load over
which instructors have no control. The primary determinant of intrinsic cognitive load is element 
interactivity. If the number of interacting elements in a content area is low it will have a low 
cognitive load with a high cognitive load generated by materials with a high level of element 
interactivity."

Element Interactivity

"Element interactivity is characterized in terms of element interactivity. The elements of most 
schemas must be learned simultaneously because they interact and it is the interaction that is 
critical. If, as in some areas, interactions between many elements must be learned, then intrinsic

cognitive load will be high. In contrast, in different areas, if elements can be learned 
successively rather than simultaneously because they do not interact, intrinsic cognitive load will
be low.

An element is defined as any material that needs to be learned.... When the elements of a task 
can be learned in isolation, they will be described as having low element interactivity. ... 
Elements interact if they are related in a manner that requires them to be assimilated 
simultaneously. ... High element interactivity or connectedness occurs when a task cannot be 
learned without simultaneously learning the connections between a large number of elements."

● Example of Low Interactivity: Learning the vocabulary of a second language can be 
seen as having low element interactivity because each word pair can be learned in 
isolation without reference to others.

● Example of High Interactivity: Learning a mathematical procedure, like multiplying out 
the denominator in an equation (a/b=c), involves a large number of interacting elements 
that must be processed simultaneously for the procedure to make sense.

Redefining "Understanding"

"The concept of understanding is only applied to some but not other material. The perspective 
taken in this paper suggests that information that needs to be "understood," rather than merely 
learned, consists of material that has a high degree of element interactivity. Material that has a 
low level of interactivity only needs to be learned rather than both understood and learned. In 
this context, understanding can be defined as the learning of high element interactivity material. 
In fact, it can be suggested that all information falls on a continuum from low to high element 
interactivity and learning is the only cognitive factor operating. When the schemas associated 
with high element interactivity material have been acquired, people feel they have understood 
the material."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Some Instructional Implications of Intrinsic Cognitive Load

"If cognitive load is caused by a combination of design features and element interactivity, then 
the extent to which it is important to design instruction to reduce extraneous cognitive load, may 
be determined by the level of element interactivity. While extraneous cognitive load can severely
reduce instructional effectiveness, it may do so only when coupled with a high intrinsic cognitive 
load. If the total cognitive load is not excessive due to a relatively low intrinsic cognitive load, 
then a high extraneous cognitive load may be irrelevant because students are readily able to 
handle low element interactivity material with almost any form of presentation. In contrast, if 
intrinsic cognitive load is high because of high element interactivity, adding a high extraneous 
cognitive load may result in a total load that substantially exceeds cognitive resources, leading 
to learning failure.

Because of the predilections of the investigators, the goal-free, worked example, split- attention 
and redundancy effects (discussed above) were all tested using high element interactivity 
materials with a high intrinsic cognitive load. Associating such materials with high extraneous 
cognitive load presentation modes may result in overwhelmingly high cognitive loads. As a 

consequence, it is to be expected that reducing extraneous cognitive by the various techniques 
associated with each effect results in substantial performance increments. Nevertheless, the 
advantages found may be available only with high element interactivity materials. All the effects 
may disappear using low element interactivity materials because total cognitive load levels may 
not exceed available capacity."

Application to Instructional Designers and Experimenters

"Instructional designers, in turn, who base their designs on cognitive load theory but whose 
materials have low element interactivity, may be incorporating design features that have no 
useful effects. The effects generated by cognitive load theory may apply only to high element 
interactivity material. As a consequence, the theory may be irrelevant when dealing with low 
element interactivity materials."
