DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper by Lawrence Barsalou provides the definitive scientific framework for Grounded 
Cognition, a theory that directly refutes the foundational assumptions of standardized testing. It 
argues that cognition is not based on abstract, amodal symbols but is "grounded" in the brain's 
systems for perception, action, and introspection. This work gives Enlitens the scientific 
language and evidence to validate its clinical interview method, demonstrating that true 
understanding of an individual's mind comes from exploring their unique, lived, and embodied 
experiences, not from comparing them to an abstract, disembodied norm.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Grounded cognition rejects traditional views that cognition is computation on amodal 

symbols in a modular system, independent of the brain’s modal systems for perception, 
action, and introspection."

● "Instead, grounded cognition proposes that modal simulations, bodily states, and 

situated action underlie cognition."

● "Simulation is the reenactment of perceptual, motor, and introspective states acquired 

during experience with the world, body, and mind."

● "According to this account, a diverse collection of simulation mechanisms, sharing a 
common representational system, supports the spectrum of cognitive activities."

● "Little empirical evidence supports the presence of amodal symbols in cognition."
● "Traditional theories have been challenged on the grounds that they fail to explain how 

cognition interfaces with perception and action (the grounding problem)."

● "If amodal symbols are to remain central in cognitive theories, empirical support is 
necessary. It will not be enough to rely on the fact that theories built from amodal 
symbols can mimic cognitive abilities."

● "Proponents of amodal views often suggest that amodal symbols play the central causal 

roles in cognitive computation, with simulations and embodiments simply being 
epiphenomenal."

● "Abstract concepts pose a classic challenge for grounded cognition. How can theories 
that focus on modal simulations explain concepts that do not appear modal? This 
concern often reflects the misperception described above that conceptual content in 
grounded theories can only come from perception of the external world. Because people
perceive internal states, however, conceptual content can come from internal sources as
well."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Foundational Principles of Grounded Cognition

● Rejection of Standard Theories: Standard theories of cognition assume that 

knowledge resides in a semantic memory system separate from the brain's modal 
systems for perception (e.g., vision, audition), action (e.g., movement, proprioception), 
and introspection (e.g., mental states, affect). According to standard theories, 
representations in modal systems are transduced into amodal symbols that represent 
knowledge.

● Core Tenets of Grounded Cognition: Grounded cognition rejects the standard view 
that amodal symbols represent knowledge in semantic memory. It proposes that 
cognition is typically grounded in multiple ways, including simulations, situated action, 
and, on occasion, bodily states.

○ Bodily States: Some accounts focus on roles of the body in cognition, based on 
widespread findings that bodily states can cause cognitive states and be effects 
of them.

○ Simulation: Most accounts of grounded cognition focus on the roles of 

simulation in cognition. Simulation is the reenactment of perceptual, motor, and 
introspective states acquired during experience with the world, body, and mind. 
As an experience occurs, the brain captures states across the modalities and 
integrates them with a multimodal representation stored in memory. Later, when 
knowledge is needed, these multimodal representations are reactivated to 
simulate how the brain represented perception, action, and introspection 
associated with it. Simulation provides a core form of computation in the brain.
○ Situated Action: Other accounts focus on situated action, social interaction, and 
the environment. The cognitive system evolved to support action in specific 
situations, including social interaction. These accounts stress interactions 
between perception, action, the body, the environment, and other agents, 
typically during goal achievement.

The Critique of Amodal Symbol Theories (The Basis of Standardized 
Testing)

● Lack of Empirical Support: Little empirical evidence supports the presence of amodal 
symbols in cognition. Instead, amodal symbols were adopted largely because they 
provided elegant and powerful formalisms for representing knowledge and could be 
implemented in artificial intelligence.

● The Grounding Problem: Traditional theories have been challenged on the grounds 

that they fail to explain how cognition interfaces with perception and action (the 
grounding problem).

● Neuroscientific Incompatibility: Traditional theories increasingly face a lack of 

understanding about where the brain stores amodal symbols and about how amodal 
symbols could be consistent with neural principles of computation.

● The Causal vs. Epiphenomenal Debate: Proponents of amodal views often suggest 
that amodal symbols play the central causal roles in cognitive computation, with 
simulations and embodiments simply being epiphenomenal. However, considerable 
evidence exists that simulations and embodiments
 do play causal roles.

○ TMS over motor areas affects linguistic processing. If motor simulations were 

epiphenomenal, modulating these brain areas should have no effect, but it does.
○ Experimentally manipulated bodily states produce extensive effects throughout 
social cognition, situated action, and linguistic processing. If these bodily states 
were epiphenomenal, they should have no effect, but they do.

○ Neuroimaging studies of conceptual processing often fail to find significant 
activations outside modal areas, suggesting that amodal processes do not 
contribute and that the active modal areas play the causal roles.

Perceptual Symbol Systems (PSS): A Grounded Theory of Concepts

● Integrating Symbolic Functions: Barsalou's (1999) theory of Perceptual Symbol 
Systems (PSS) argued that traditional approaches are correct in postulating the 
importance of symbolic operations for interpreting experience. PSS demonstrated that 
grounded theories can implement symbolic functions naturally.

● Simulators: Through the construct of simulators—corresponding roughly to concepts 

and types in standard theories—PSS implements the standard symbolic functions of 
type-token binding, inference, productivity, recursion, and propositions. It retains the 
symbolic functionality of traditional theories but implements it differently, using simulation
and dynamic systems.

● A Unifying System: PSS assumes that a single, multimodal representation system in 
the brain supports diverse forms of simulation across different cognitive processes. 
According to PSS, simulation is a unifying computational principle across diverse 
processes in the brain, taking different forms for each.

Grounding Abstract Concepts

● The Challenge: Abstract concepts pose a classic challenge for grounded cognition.
● The Solution: Internal States and Situations:

○ The concern often reflects the misperception that conceptual content in grounded

theories can only come from perception of the external world.

○ Because people perceive internal states, conceptual content can come from 

internal sources as well.

○ Recent embodiment theorists propose that knowledge acquired from 

introspection is central to the representation of abstract concepts. Preliminary 
evidence suggests that introspective information is indeed central.

○ Simulations of internal states could provide much of the conceptual content 

central to abstract concepts.

○ Abstract concepts also appear to depend heavily on situations and situated 

action. Processing an abstract concept by itself is difficult but becomes much 
easier when a background situation contextualizes it.

○ Cognitive linguistics theories propose that abstract concepts are grounded 

metaphorically in embodied and situated knowledge. For example, affective 
experience can be understood as verticality ("happy is up, sad is down").

KEY EVIDENCE FOR GROUNDED 
COGNITION

Conceptual Processing

● Behavioral Evidence: In property verification tasks (e.g., verifying if a HORSE has a 

mane), perceptual variables like size predict response times, suggesting people simulate
the concept to check its properties. Switching between modalities (e.g., from a visual 
property to an auditory one) incurs a processing cost, just as it does in perception.

● Lesion Evidence: Damage to specific modal brain areas leads to deficits for categories 

that rely on that modality.

○ Damage to visual areas increases the likelihood of losing knowledge about 

animals.

○ Damage to motor areas increases the likelihood of losing knowledge about tools.

● Neuroimaging Evidence: When people think about object concepts, the brain areas 

used to perceive their properties become active.

○ Thinking about animals activates visual areas.
○ Thinking about artifacts activates motor areas.
○ Thinking about foods activates gustatory (taste) areas.
○ Thinking about things that smell activates olfactory areas.

Language Comprehension

● Perceptual Simulation: Readers construct simulations containing implicit perceptual 
information. When reading "The ranger saw the eagle in the sky," people are faster to 
recognize a picture of an eagle with its wings outstretched than one with its wings folded,
because they have simulated the shape.

● Motor Simulation: Simply reading a word for an action activates the corresponding area
of the motor system. Verbs for head, arm, and leg actions produce simulations in the 
respective head, arm, and leg areas of the motor system.

● Affective Simulation: People simulate emotional states during comprehension. When 
participants' faces were configured into a specific emotional expression (e.g., a smile), 
they were better at comprehending sentences with matching emotional content.

Social Cognition

● Embodiment Effects:

○ Cognition Causes Bodily States: Activating the "elderly" stereotype causes 

people to walk more slowly.

○ Bodily States Cause Cognition: Engaging the smiling musculature produces 

positive affect. Slumping produces negative affect.

● Social Mirroring and Simulation:

○ Theories propose we represent other people's minds by simulating them in our 

own minds. To feel someone's pain, we simulate our own pain.

○ Mirror neuron circuits underlie this process. These circuits help perceivers infer 

an actor's intention, not just recognize the action.

○ Simulation provides a general mechanism for establishing empathy.
○ Individual differences in the ability to simulate others' mental states correlate with

rated empathy.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS & 
METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

● Integrating Disciplines: Grounded cognition has significant potential to integrate 

cognitive, social, and developmental processes, as all three fields have increasingly 
incorporated simulation, situations, and bodily states. This supports Enlitens' holistic 
approach.

● Focus on Development: Development depends critically on bodily states and situated 
action. Motor actions performed while learning a category influence the visual features 
abstracted into its representation. This highlights the importance of understanding an 
individual's full developmental and experiential history.

● Grounding Classic Paradigms: The paper argues that for grounded cognition to be 
fully accepted, it must show how classic paradigms can be understood within its 
framework. For example, a production in a production system could be re-envisioned not
as amodal symbols, but as an association between a perception (the condition) and an 
action (the action). This provides a path for Enlitens to re-interpret and critique existing 
psychological constructs.

● The Need for New Theories: Grounded cognition suffers from a lack of well-specified 

computational theories. Now that modal processing in higher cognition is becoming well-
documented, it is time to develop these accounts and the experiments that test them. 
This represents the frontier where Enlitens is operating—building a new, grounded 
model of assessment.
