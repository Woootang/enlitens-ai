DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a reappraisal article by Craddock and Owen (2010) arguing that the 
"Kraepelinian dichotomy"—the traditional psychiatric division between schizophrenia 
and bipolar (manic-depressive) illness—is no longer tenable in light of modern genetic 
evidence. The authors summarize findings from large-scale family and molecular 
studies (including GWAS and CNV research) that show a significant overlap in genetic 
susceptibility between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and even neurodevelopmental 
disorders like autism. They propose moving away from rigid, separate disease 
categories toward a more biologically plausible dimensional model that conceptualizes 
these conditions along a gradient of neurodevelopmental and affective pathology.

The Kraepelinian dichotomy – going, going.. but still not 
gone

Nick Craddock and Michael J. Owen

Summary

Recent genetic studies reinforce the view that current approaches to the 
diagnosis and classification of major psychiatric illness are inadequate. 
These findings challenge the distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder, and suggest that more attention should be given to the relationship 
between the functional psychoses and neurodevelopmental disorders such 
as autism. We are entering a transitional period of several years during 
which psychiatry will need to move from using traditional descriptive 
diagnoses to clinical entities (categories and/or dimensions) that relate more 
closely to the underlying workings of the brain.

Findings inconsistent with the Kraepelinian dichotomy

Several studies have been published in the past 5 years that provide compelling 
evidence that genetic susceptibility and, by implication, elements of the underlying 
pathogenetic mechanisms are shared between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Key findings include the largest family study of the two disorders ever conducted that 
shows overlap in genetic susceptibility across bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. 
This study... showed that there are increased risks of both schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder in first-degree relatives of probands with either disorder.

Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated the 
existence of common DNA variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that influence 
risk of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Perhaps most compellingly, there is 
strong evidence that the aggregate polygenic contribution of many alleles of small effect
to susceptibility for schizophrenia also influences susceptibility to bipolar disorder.

Although a great deal of work remains to be undertaken... the studies 
described above indicate that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (and 
recurrent depression) do not 'breed true', but have an overlap in genetic risk 
and are therefore likely to share some aspects of pathogenesis. This does 
not equate to a simple dichotomous notion of completely distinct and 
unrelated disease categories and allows us to reject the traditional, simplistic
view of the dichotomy.

Findings indicating the need to reconsider the interface between 
psychosis and autism

It has recently been recognised that structural genomic variants of small or modest size 
(copy number variants (CNVs) of stretches of DNA of 1000 base pairs or more) are a 
common cause of genetic variation in humans, and such variants have been reported in
neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including autism, 'mental retardation' (intellectual 
disability) and schizophrenia.

The specific CNVs associated with risk of schizophrenia also confer risk of multiple 
neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including autism and mental retardation. This indicates 
an overlap of genetic susceptibility and pathogenesis across the categories of 
schizophrenia, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and challenges the 
view that these are completely unrelated diagnostic entities.

Findings suggesting that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia do 
not have a single underlying cause and are not the same clinical 
entity

Although we can reject a simple model of separate, unrelated disease categories, the 
data do not support a model of a single-disease category... For example, the same 
large family study that demonstrated a substantial overlap in genetic susceptibility to 

bipolar disorder and schizophrenia also provided clear evidence for the existence of 
non-shared genetic risk factors.

Recent studies suggest that some of this specificity might be due to CNVs. Although 
there is emerging evidence that CNVs have some influence on the risk of bipolar 
disorder, they appear to contribute less to the susceptibility to bipolar disorder than to
schizophrenia... these findings are consistent with the view that schizophrenia has a 
stronger neurodevelopmental component than bipolar disorder and suggest that it lies 
on a gradient of decreasing neurodevelopmental impairment between syndromes such 
as mental retardation and autism on one hand, and bipolar disorder on the other (Fig. 
1).

Moving towards more biologically plausible and clinically useful 
models of psychosis

The main clinical aims of diagnosis include the optimisation of treatments and allowing 
useful prognostic statements to be made. The history of medicine suggests that 
therapeutic and prognostic decision-making are usually facilitated... as classifications 
move closer to the underlying biological mechanisms.

In our 2005 editorial we suggested that recent evidence made it necessary 
to consider a mood-psychosis clinical dimension with at least three possible 
overlapping broad domains of psychopathology ('prototype schizophrenia', 
'schizoaffective' and 'prototype bipolar'). More recent genetic data are 
broadly consistent with such a model. However, these newer data also point 
to the need to consider a broader clinical spectrum that includes also autism
and mental retardation/cognitive impairment at one end and non-psychotic 
mood disorder at the other.

Conclusion

At a time of transition it will be necessary to be open-minded and flexible. Care must be 
taken to ensure that the diagnostic entities (be they dimensions, categories or a 
mixture) are based on solid data, are usable and have proven clinical utility. Inevitably, 
research must move faster and be willing to explore a wide range of options 
unconstrained by current diagnostic categories.

In our view, the most pragmatic solution to current needs is to encourage the
careful measurement and reappraisal of psychopathology by using 
dimensional measures of key domains of psychopathology which can sit 
alongside the use of categories.

At the beginning of the 21st century, we must set our sights higher.
