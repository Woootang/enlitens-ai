DOCUMENT SUMMARY This landmark 2024 paper reports the largest-ever epigenome-wide 
meta-analysis of PTSD, synthesizing data from over 5,000 individuals across 23 cohorts. It 
identifies 11 specific DNA methylation sites robustly associated with PTSD, implicating genes 
involved in immune function and neurodevelopment, most notably AHRR and CDC42BPB. 
Crucially, the study provides strong evidence that these epigenetic signals found in blood are 
relevant to the brain, with findings correlating with methylation patterns in postmortem brain 
tissue and expression levels of the associated genes, solidifying the biological embedding of 
trauma.

Epigenome-wide association studies 
identify novel DNA methylation sites 
associated with PTSD: a meta-analysis of 
23 military and civilian cohorts

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This is the largest and most definitive study of its kind, providing a "gold standard" reference for 
the specific epigenetic changes associated with PTSD. It is core to our work because it provides
robust, large-scale evidence for the biological embedding of trauma. The study's validation of 
blood-based findings with postmortem brain data is a major step forward, supporting the idea 
that accessible biomarkers can indeed reflect central nervous system processes. The biological 
pathways identified—primarily related to the immune system and stress response—strongly 
support our model of trauma as a state of chronic, systemic physiological dysregulation rather 
than a purely psychological condition.

Critical Findings for Our Work

This paper conducted a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) on post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Study Scale & Population

● Massive Sample: The study included data from 5,077 individuals across 23 civilian 

and military cohorts.

● Design: It compared 2,156 individuals with current PTSD to 2,921 trauma-exposed 

controls who did not have PTSD.

● Diversity: The sample was diverse, including both military and civilian populations, 41% 

female, 46% European ancestry, and 43% African ancestry.

Primary Epigenetic Findings in Blood

● Identified CpG Sites: The meta-analysis identified 11 specific CpG sites where DNA 
methylation (DNAm) was significantly associated with a PTSD diagnosis. Nine of these 
were novel findings not identified in previous, smaller studies.

● Key Genes Implicated by DNAm:

○ AHRR (Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor): Replicated previous findings, 
linking PTSD to lower methylation in this gene. AHRR is involved in immune 
regulation and detoxification. The study suggests this link is independent of 
smoking status.

○ CDC42BPB: A novel finding linking PTSD to higher methylation in this gene. 

This gene is involved in neurodevelopment and has previously been associated 
with inflammation (C-reactive protein) and depression.

○ Other Implicated Genes: Other genes identified included GFI1, CHD5, TOLLIP,
ADCY4, and BANP, which are broadly involved in stress response, immune 
function, and neural plasticity.

Blood-Brain Relevance (The "Tissue Issue")

A critical part of the study was confirming that these epigenetic signals found in blood are 
meaningful for the brain.

● Blood-Brain Correlation: Many of the top CpG sites showed a correlation between 
methylation levels in blood and in various brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, 
amygdala).

● Shared PTSD Signal: The overall pattern of PTSD-associated methylation in blood 

showed a statistically significant overlap with the pattern found in the amygdala of 
postmortem brains.

● Specific Gene Confirmation: The PTSD-associated methylation change in CDC42BPB
was observed in the same direction in both blood and the dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (dlPFC).

Evidence of Biological Function

The study went beyond simple association to test if these epigenetic marks have a real 
biological function.

● Gene Expression: Methylation levels at 5 of the 9 key gene sites were significantly 
correlated with the actual expression levels of those genes in blood, suggesting the 
methylation has a regulatory effect.

● Response to Stress: Four of the 11 top CpG sites showed methylation changes in a 
laboratory model where human fibroblast cells were exposed to the stress hormone 
cortisol for a prolonged period, directly linking these sites to a biological stress response.

Methodological Considerations We Can Learn From

● The Power of Meta-Analysis: This study is a product of the Psychiatric Genomics 

Consortium (PGC) and demonstrates the immense power of large-scale collaboration. 
By combining data from 23 studies, it was able to produce robust, replicable findings that
are impossible for any single research group to achieve.

● Multi-Modal Integration: The paper provides a blueprint for making sense of epigenetic
findings. It integrates data from epigenetics (EWAS), genetics (GWAS), gene expression
(RNA-seq), and cellular models to build a comprehensive biological picture of PTSD.

Quotes We Might Use

● On the study's aim: "Here, we aim to identify blood DNAm differences associated with 

PTSD and characterize the underlying biological mechanisms by examining the extent to
which they mirror associations across multiple brain regions".

● On the main finding: "This study identifies 11 PTSD-associated CpGs and leverages 
data from postmortem brain samples, GWAS, and genome-wide expression data to 
interpret the biology underlying these associations and prioritize genes whose regulation
differs in those with PTSD".

● On the blood-brain connection: "Many of these loci exhibit blood-brain correlation in 

methylation levels and cross-tissue associations with PTSD in multiple brain regions".

● On the key pathways involved: "Supporting data from multiple sources suggest that 
epigenetic mechanisms, particularly methylation in AHRR and CDC42BPB, may 
contribute to the complex relationship between the immune system and PTSD".

Clinical Implications

● Targets for Treatment: The study's findings point to specific biological pathways—

particularly those related to immune function, inflammation, and stress response—that 
are dysregulated in PTSD. This provides clear targets for the development of novel 
pharmacological or biological treatments.

● Future of Biomarkers: The robust blood-based findings and their confirmed relevance 
to brain tissue strongly support the ongoing effort to develop accessible biomarkers. 
While not yet ready for clinical use, these findings are a major step toward creating tools 
that could one day help in diagnosing, predicting risk, or monitoring treatment response 
for PTSD.
