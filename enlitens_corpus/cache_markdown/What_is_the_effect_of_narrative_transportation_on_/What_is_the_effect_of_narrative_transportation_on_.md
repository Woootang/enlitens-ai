Yes, narrative transportation—the immersive experience of being "lost" in a story
—can change deeply held beliefs, especially when individuals are highly
transported, though effects depend on the quality of the narrative, the audience,
and the context.

1. Introduction

Narrative transportation refers to the psychological state of being deeply absorbed in a story, such that the real

world temporarily fades and the narrative world becomes central to the reader or viewer’s experience. A robust

body of research demonstrates that when individuals are highly transported into a narrative, they are more likely to

adopt beliefs, attitudes, and intentions consistent with the story—even when these run counter to their prior,

deeply held beliefs (Green & Brock, 2000; Green, 2021; Green, 2006; Appel & Richter, 2007; Mazzocco et al., 2010;

Green & Clark, 2013; Appel & Richter, 2010; Green & Fitzgerald, 2017; Oschatz & Marker, 2020; Moore & Miller,

2020; Green, 2004; Igartua & Barrios, 2012; Boukes & LaMarre, 2021). This effect has been observed across

domains, including climate change, health, social issues, and political attitudes (Merry & Payne, 2025; Green, 2006;

Flores et al., 2022; Bieniek-Tobasco et al., 2020; Andrews et al., 2022; Igartua & Barrios, 2012; Kalla & Broockman,

2020; Gans & Zhan, 2025). However, the power of narrative transportation is moderated by factors such as the

individual’s tendency to become transported (transportability), the emotional and cognitive quality of the narrative,
and the degree of similarity or identification with characters (Mazzocco et al., 2010; Kubrak & Starostina, 2023;

Green, 2004; Ooms et al., 2019). While narrative transportation can sometimes overcome resistance to persuasion,

it is not universally effective, and preexisting beliefs, social context, and narrative credibility can limit its impact

(Polletta & Redman, 2020; Zebregs et al., 2015). This review synthesizes the evidence on how and when narrative

transportation changes deeply held beliefs.

3. Results

3.1 Narrative Transportation and Belief Change

•

Experimental and survey studies consistently show that higher levels of narrative transportation predict greater

adoption of story-consistent beliefs, even when these beliefs are deeply held or initially resistant to change

(Green & Brock, 2000; Green, 2021; Green, 2006; Appel & Richter, 2007; Mazzocco et al., 2010; Green & Clark,

2013; Appel & Richter, 2010; Green & Fitzgerald, 2017; Oschatz & Marker, 2020; Moore & Miller, 2020; Green,
2004; Igartua & Barrios, 2012; Boukes & LaMarre, 2021).

•

•

Meta-analyses confirm a positive, though moderate, relationship between narrative exposure and belief

change (r ≈ .17–.19), with transportation acting as a key mediator (Braddock & Dillard, 2016; Oschatz & Marker,
2020).

Longitudinal studies indicate that the effects of narrative transportation can persist or even increase over time,

as beliefs acquired from stories are integrated into real-world knowledge (Appel & Richter, 2007; Oschatz &
Marker, 2020).

3.2 Mechanisms of Narrative Transportation

•

•

•

Reduced counterarguing: Immersion in a narrative reduces critical scrutiny and resistance, making audiences

more open to new perspectives (Green, 2021; Fitzgerald & Green, 2017; Green & Clark, 2013; Green &

Fitzgerald, 2017; Boukes & LaMarre, 2021; Moyer-Gusé et al., 2022).

Emotional engagement and identification: Emotional shifts, empathy, and identification with characters

enhance transportation and facilitate belief change (Mazzocco et al., 2010; Kubrak & Starostina, 2023; Nabi &

Green, 2015; Winkler et al., 2022; Ooms et al., 2019; Wang & Tang, 2021).

Perceived realism and similarity: Stories perceived as realistic or featuring relatable characters are more likely

to transport and persuade (Green, 2004; Ooms et al., 2019; Graaf & Hustinx, 2015).

2 / 9

3.3 Moderators and Limitations

•

•

•

Transportability: Individuals with a higher tendency to become transported are more susceptible to narrative-

induced belief change (Mazzocco et al., 2010; Kubrak & Starostina, 2023; Green, 2004).

Preexisting beliefs and context: Strong prior beliefs, social context, and narrative credibility can limit or even

reverse the effects of transportation (Polletta & Redman, 2020; Zebregs et al., 2015).

Narrative quality: Well-crafted, emotionally engaging, and vivid narratives are more effective at transporting
and persuading (Kubrak & Starostina, 2023; Nabi & Green, 2015; Boukes & LaMarre, 2021; Wang & Tang, 2021).

3.4 Applications and Domains

•

•

Health, climate, and social issues: Narrative transportation has been shown to shift beliefs and attitudes in

domains such as climate change, health behaviors, and social policy (Merry & Payne, 2025; Green, 2006; Flores

et al., 2022; Bieniek-Tobasco et al., 2020; Andrews et al., 2022; Igartua & Barrios, 2012; Kalla & Broockman,
2020; Gans & Zhan, 2025).

Political and controversial topics: Narratives can moderate or polarize attitudes on contentious issues,

sometimes bridging divides or, in other cases, reinforcing preexisting views (Flores et al., 2022; Cohen et al.,
2015; Igartua & Barrios, 2012; Kalla & Broockman, 2020; Gans & Zhan, 2025).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports the idea that narrative transportation can change deeply held beliefs, especially

when individuals are highly immersed in the story (Green & Brock, 2000; Green, 2021; Green, 2006; Appel &

Richter, 2007; Mazzocco et al., 2010; Green & Clark, 2013; Appel & Richter, 2010; Green & Fitzgerald, 2017;

Oschatz & Marker, 2020; Moore & Miller, 2020; Green, 2004; Igartua & Barrios, 2012; Boukes & LaMarre, 2021).

The mechanisms underlying this effect include reduced counterarguing, emotional engagement, and identification

with characters, which together lower resistance and facilitate the integration of new perspectives (Green, 2021;
Fitzgerald & Green, 2017; Green & Clark, 2013; Green & Fitzgerald, 2017; Boukes & LaMarre, 2021; Moyer-Gusé et

al., 2022). However, the effect is not universal: individuals with strong preexisting beliefs, low transportability, or

skepticism toward the narrative may resist or even reject story-consistent beliefs (Mazzocco et al., 2010; Polletta &

Redman, 2020; Zebregs et al., 2015). The quality and realism of the narrative, as well as the social and cultural

context, also play crucial roles in determining the extent of belief change (Kubrak & Starostina, 2023; Green, 2004;

Nabi & Green, 2015; Boukes & LaMarre, 2021; Wang & Tang, 2021; Graaf & Hustinx, 2015).

While narrative transportation is a powerful tool for persuasion, it is most effective when the story is well-crafted,

emotionally engaging, and features relatable characters. The effect is particularly notable in domains where

traditional, fact-based persuasion often fails, such as climate change, health behaviors, and social or political issues

(Merry & Payne, 2025; Green, 2006; Flores et al., 2022; Bieniek-Tobasco et al., 2020; Andrews et al., 2022; Igartua
& Barrios, 2012; Kalla & Broockman, 2020; Gans & Zhan, 2025). However, more research is needed to understand

the boundaries of this effect, especially in highly polarized or resistant audiences (Polletta & Redman, 2020;

Zebregs et al., 2015).

5. Conclusion

Narrative transportation is a robust mechanism for changing deeply held beliefs, especially when individuals are
highly immersed in a well-crafted, emotionally engaging story. Its effects are strongest when resistance is low, the

narrative is relatable, and the audience is open to being transported.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for the persuasive power of narrative transportation, more research is needed on its limits,

the role of social context, and strategies for overcoming resistance in highly polarized audiences.
