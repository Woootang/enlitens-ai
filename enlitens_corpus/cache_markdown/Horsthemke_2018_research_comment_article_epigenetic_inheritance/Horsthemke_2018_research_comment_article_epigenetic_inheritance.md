DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a scientific commentary by Horsthemke (2018) that provides a critical 
perspective on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans—the idea that 
epigenetic information (like DNA methylation) can be transmitted through the germline 
to affect subsequent generations. The author argues that while this phenomenon is 
observed in plants and some animals, conclusive proof in humans is scarce and 
controversial. The paper highlights the major challenges in studying this topic, such as 
confounding factors from genetic, ecological, and cultural inheritance, and explains 
how phenomena like "fetal programming" and "secondary epimutations" are often 
mistaken for true transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The author concludes with a 
skeptical view, suggesting that for humans, the impact of cultural inheritance likely 
surpasses any detectable epigenetic effects.

A critical view on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance 
in humans

Bernhard Horsthemke

Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance refers to the transmission of epigenetic 
information through the germline. While it has been observed in plants, nematodes and 
fruit flies, its occurrence in mammals—and humans in particular—is the matter of 
controversial debate, mostly because the study of transgenerational epigenetic 
inheritance is confounded by genetic, ecological and cultural inheritance.

Defining transgenerational epigenetic inheritance

Although epigenetics deals only with the cellular inheritance of chromatin and gene 
expression states, it has been proposed that epigenetic features could also be 
transmitted through the germline and persist in subsequent generations. The 

widespread interest in “transgenerational epigenetic inheritance” is nourished by the 
hope that epigenetic mechanisms might provide a basis for the inheritance of acquired 
traits. Yes, Lamarck has never been dead and every so often raises his head, this time 
with the help of epigenetics. Although acquired traits concerning body or brain functions 
can be written down in the epigenome of a cell, they cannot easily be transmitted from 
one generation to the next. For this to occur, these epigenetic changes would have to 
manifest in the germ cells as well, which in mammals are separated from somatic cells 
by the so-called Weismann barrier. Further, the chromatin is extensively reshaped 
during germ cell differentiation as well as during the development of totipotent cells after
fertilization.

Fetal programming and intergenerational inheritance

Genetic inheritance alone cannot fully explain why we resemble our parents. In addition 
to genes, we inherited from our parents the environment and culture, which in parts 
have been constructed by the previous generations. A specific form of the environment 
is our mother's womb, to which we were exposed during the first 9 months of our life. 
The maternal environment can have long-lasting effects on our health. In the Dutch 
hunger winter, for example, severe undernourishment affected pregnant women, their 
unborn offspring and the offspring's fetal germ cells. The increased incidence of 
cardiovascular and metabolic disease observed in F1 adults is not due to the 
transmission of epigenetic information through the maternal germline, but a direct 
consequence of the exposure in utero, a phenomenon called "fetal programming" or if 
fetal germ cells and F2 offspring are affected—"intergenerational inheritance".

Secondary epimutations

Several studies... have reported the co-segregation of an abnormal DNA methylation 
pattern (called "epimutation") with a rare disease in two or more generations of certain 
families. In these cases, the abnormal DNA methylation of the gene under investigation 
was linked to a mutation in a neighboring gene... In contrast to a primary epimutation, 
which occurs independently of any DNA sequence change, this is a secondary 
epimutation, which strictly depends on the expression of the mutated neighboring 
gene. If this gene is expressed also in the germline... the epimutation is also found in 
germ cells, which should not be mistaken for transgenerational epigenetic 
inheritance.

Roadmap to proving transgenerational epigenetic inheritance

1. Rule out genetic, ecological and cultural inheritance. For studies in mice and 
rats, inbred strains and strictly controlled environments need to be used... In 
contrast with laboratory animals, it is impossible to rule out ecological and 
cultural inheritance in humans, but genetic effects should and can be excluded.
Identify the responsible epigenetic factor in the germ cells. Be aware that 
germ cell preparations may be contaminated with somatic cells or somatic DNA.
3. Demonstrate that the epigenetic factor in the germ cells is responsible for 
the phenotypic effect in the next generation. While RNA molecules can and 
have been extracted from sperm of exposed animals and injected into control 

2.

zygotes, DNA methylation and histone modifications cannot easily be 
manipulated... and all of these experiments can hardly be done in humans.

Transgenerational inheritance in the light of evolution

In plants, nematodes and fruit flies, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is well 
documented. It has been argued that this form of inheritance may permit a population to
adapt to fluctuating environments. The question is whether this is also true for mammals
and, particularly, humans. Almost all of the experimental mouse models and the few 
observations in humans concern deleterious traits (congenital malformations, anxiety, 
glucose intolerance, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and premature death)... 
this may, at least in part, be due to reporting bias... but overall casts doubt on an 
adaptive role of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in these cases.

That transgenerational inheritance of chromatin marks is so rarely observed 
in mammals may be a side effect of the extensive epigenetic reprogramming
required for germ cell development and early embryogenesis in mammals, 
which could also serve as a mechanism to prevent the transmission of 
environmental insults that animals have encountered during their life.

In conclusion, in my opinion, even if the molecular mechanisms exist to transmit 
epigenetic information across generations in humans, it is very likely that the 
transgenerational transmission of culture by communication, imitation, teaching and 
learning surpasses the effects of epigenetic inheritance and our ability to detect this 
phenomenon. Cultural inheritance has certainly had an adaptive role in the evolution 
of our species, but the evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, as laid 
out above, is not (yet) conclusive. For now, I remain skeptical.
