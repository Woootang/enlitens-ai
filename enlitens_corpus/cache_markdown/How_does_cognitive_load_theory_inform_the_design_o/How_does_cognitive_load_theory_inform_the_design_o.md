Cognitive Load Theory and the Design of Effective Educational Materials

1. Introduction

Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) is a foundational framework in educational psychology that informs the design of

instructional materials by considering the limitations of human cognitive architecture—specifically, the restricted

capacity of working memory and the virtually unlimited capacity of long-term memory (Van Merriënboer & Sweller,

2010; Paas et al., 2003; Sweller et al., 1998; Sweller et al., 2019). CLT distinguishes between intrinsic, extraneous,

and germane cognitive load, and provides evidence-based principles to optimize learning by reducing unnecessary

mental effort and focusing cognitive resources on schema acquisition and automation (Van Merriënboer & Sweller,

2010; Young et al., 2014; Paas et al., 2003; Sweller et al., 1998; Sweller, 1994; Sweller et al., 2019). Over the past

three decades, CLT has generated a wide array of instructional design strategies, such as worked examples, split-

attention reduction, modality integration, signaling, and segmenting, which have been empirically validated across

diverse educational contexts, including digital, multimedia, and health professions education (Castro-Alonso et al.,

2021; Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Young et al., 2014; Noetel et al., 2021; Sweller et al., 1998; Hadie et al., 2021;

Castro-Alonso et al., 2019; Chandler & Sweller, 1991). The theory continues to evolve, integrating insights from

neuroscience, technology, and collaborative learning, and remains central to the development of effective, learner-

centered educational materials (Hanham et al., 2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Ginns & Leppink, 2019; Gkintoni et

al., 2025; Sweller et al., 2019).

2. Methods

A comprehensive Deep Search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search targeted cognitive load theory, instructional design,

and educational material optimization. Out of 1,024 identified papers, 506 were screened, 428 met eligibility
criteria, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1 Core Principles of Cognitive Load Theory

CLT is grounded in the understanding that working memory is limited in both capacity and duration, while long-

term memory can store complex schemas indefinitely (Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Paas et al., 2003; Sweller

et al., 1998; Sweller et al., 2019). The theory distinguishes:

•

•

•

Intrinsic load: The inherent complexity of the material, determined by element interactivity and learner

expertise (Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Paas et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2023; Sweller, 1994).

Extraneous load: Cognitive effort imposed by poor instructional design, which does not contribute to learning

(Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Paas et al., 2003; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Sweller et al., 1998; Chandler &

Sweller, 1991).

Germane load: Cognitive resources devoted to schema construction and automation, which should be

maximized (Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Paas et al., 2003; Sweller et al., 1998; Sweller, 1994).

3.2 Instructional Design Strategies Informed by CLT

Empirical research has led to the development of several evidence-based instructional design principles:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Worked examples: Providing step-by-step solutions to problems reduces extraneous load and supports

schema acquisition, especially for novices (Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Young et al., 2014; Paas et al.,

2003; Sweller et al., 1998; Chandler & Sweller, 1991).

Split-attention and spatial contiguity: Integrating text and visuals spatially and temporally prevents

unnecessary mental integration and reduces extraneous load (Castro-Alonso et al., 2021; Klepsch & Seufert,

2020; Castro-Alonso et al., 2019; Chandler & Sweller, 1991).

Redundancy and coherence: Removing nonessential or repetitive information prevents overload and focuses

attention on key concepts (Castro-Alonso et al., 2021; Noetel et al., 2021; Castro-Alonso et al., 2019).

Signaling (cueing): Highlighting essential information guides attention and improves learning efficiency (Castro-

Alonso et al., 2021; Noetel et al., 2021; Castro-Alonso et al., 2019).

Segmenting and pacing: Breaking complex information into manageable segments allows learners to process
material at their own pace, reducing overload (Castro-Alonso et al., 2021; Noetel et al., 2021; Castro-Alonso et

al., 2019).

Modality effect: Presenting information using both visual and auditory channels can optimize working memory
use (Castro-Alonso et al., 2021; Castro-Alonso et al., 2019).

3.3 Applications in Digital and Multimedia Learning

CLT principles are especially relevant in digital and multimedia environments, where the risk of cognitive overload

is high due to complex, interactive, or multimedia content (Castro-Alonso et al., 2021; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021;

Noetel et al., 2021; Surbakti et al., 2024; Castro-Alonso et al., 2019). Studies show that applying CLT-based design
(e.g., segmenting, signaling, reducing redundancy) in online and technology-enhanced learning environments

improves comprehension, engagement, and retention (Castro-Alonso et al., 2021; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Noetel et

al., 2021; Surbakti et al., 2024; Hadie et al., 2021; Castro-Alonso et al., 2019; Chandler & Sweller, 1991).

3.4 Adaptation to Learner Expertise and Context

The expertise reversal effect highlights that instructional techniques effective for novices may become less

effective or even detrimental for advanced learners, necessitating adaptive instructional design (Castro-Alonso et
al., 2021; Young et al., 2014; Paas et al., 2003; Leppink & Van Den Heuvel, 2015; Kalyuga & Singh, 2016). CLT also

informs collaborative and simulation-based learning, emphasizing the need to manage collective cognitive load and

support schema construction in complex, real-world tasks (Kirschner et al., 2018; Fraser et al., 2015; Wasfy et al.,
2021).

4. Discussion

Cognitive Load Theory has profoundly shaped the design of effective educational materials by providing a scientific

basis for instructional decisions that align with human cognitive architecture (Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010;
Paas et al., 2003; Sweller et al., 1998; Sweller et al., 2019). The theory’s distinction between intrinsic, extraneous,

and germane load enables designers to systematically analyze and optimize learning tasks, reducing unnecessary

mental effort and maximizing schema acquisition (Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Paas et al., 2003; Sweller et al.,

1998; Sweller, 1994). Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of CLT-based strategies—such as worked

examples, split-attention reduction, signaling, and segmenting—across a wide range of domains and delivery

formats (Castro-Alonso et al., 2021; Van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2010; Young et al., 2014; Noetel et al., 2021; Sweller

et al., 1998; Hadie et al., 2021; Castro-Alonso et al., 2019; Chandler & Sweller, 1991).

However, CLT is not without limitations. Some critics argue that the theory can be overly prescriptive or

reductionist, and that reducing cognitive load is not always beneficial—some productive struggle may enhance
learning in certain contexts (Jong, 2010; Kalyuga & Singh, 2016; Schnotz & Kürschner, 2007). The theory continues

to evolve, incorporating insights from neuroscience, adaptive learning, and collaborative contexts, and ongoing

research seeks to refine measurement tools and address challenges such as the expertise reversal effect and the

integration of affective and motivational factors (Hanham et al., 2023; Skulmowski & Xu, 2021; Ginns & Leppink,

2019; Gkintoni et al., 2025; Sweller et al., 2019; Firdaus et al., 2025).
