DOCUMENT SUMMARY This qualitative study demonstrates that standard trauma measures 
are inadequate for autistic individuals, as they fail to capture a wide range of experiences that 
are perceived as traumatic. Through in-depth interviews with autistic adults and caregivers, the 
research identifies unique sources of trauma arising from the conflict between autistic traits and 
an unaccommodating environment, such as sensory trauma, social exclusion, and feeling 
psychologically trapped. The findings provide powerful evidence that open-ended, person-
centered inquiry is essential to understand the lived experiences and mental health needs of 
autistic people.

Exploring potential sources of childhood 
trauma: A qualitative study with autistic 
adults and caregivers

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper provides the ultimate empirical validation for the Enlitens assessment methodology. 
It proves, through rigorous qualitative research, that standardized checklists are fundamentally 
insufficient for capturing the traumatic experiences of autistic people. The central finding—that 
100% of participants described traumas that were missed by a standard measure—is the 
single most powerful piece of evidence we can use to argue for the necessity of our in-depth, 
interview-based approach.

The study not only critiques the old model but also provides a framework for the new one by 
identifying specific, nuanced categories of trauma (like sensory trauma, social confusion, and 
feeling trapped) that are central to the autistic experience. This research is our cornerstone; it 
allows us to state unequivocally that to understand an autistic person, you cannot rely on a 
checklist—you must listen to their story.

Critical Statistics and Facts for Our Work

● Standardized Measures are Insufficient: 100% of autistic adults and caregivers 
described sources of trauma in their interviews that were not captured by the 
standardized Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ).

● "Other Trauma" is Common: 71% of autistic adults and 47% of caregivers endorsed 
the "other trauma" category on the THQ, indicating that the specific listed items did not 
cover their experiences.

● High Rates of Undiagnosed PTSD: The majority of autistic adults in the study (71%) 

exceeded the clinical cut-off for PTSD on a standardized measure, but only three had a 
prior community diagnosis of PTSD.

● Bullying and Emotional Abuse are Pervasive: Bullying was endorsed on the THQ by 
100% of autistic adults and was one of the most frequently described trauma sources in 
interviews for all participants.

Methodology We Can Learn From

The methodology of this study is a blueprint for the Enlitens approach to inquiry.

● Qualitative Interviews: The study relied on in-depth, semi-structured interviews, 

demonstrating that this open-ended method is essential for uncovering experiences that 
quantitative tools miss.

● Community Input: The interview guide was piloted and revised with input from autistic 

adults, caregivers, and researchers from diverse disciplines to ensure it was 
appropriately tailored and balanced potential biases.

● Mixed-Method Analysis: The researchers directly compared the qualitative data from 

interviews with the quantitative data from a standardized checklist (the THQ), providing a
clear and powerful demonstration of the checklist's shortcomings.

● Reflexive Thematic Analysis: The researchers used an integrated inductive ("bottom-
up") and deductive ("top-down") approach to identify themes, allowing for both the 
confirmation of known trauma types and the discovery of novel ones specific to the 
autistic experience.

Findings That Challenge the System

Standardized Trauma Measures Fail Autistic People

The study's core finding is a direct indictment of relying on standardized checklists for autistic 
individuals. Such measures omit adversities that are experienced as deeply traumatic by those 
on the spectrum, preventing a full understanding of what contributes to poor health outcomes. 
The authors conclude that there is a clear need to adapt current measures and diagnostic 
criteria to include a broader range of stressors.

Redefining Trauma for the Autistic Experience

The qualitative interviews revealed several novel themes of trauma that arise from the 
interaction between autistic traits and an unaccommodating environment.

● Traumatic Incongruities: This major theme describes trauma arising from the 

mismatch between the sensory, social, and executive processing of autistic individuals 
and the external world.

○ Sensory Trauma: Everyday sensory experiences like haircuts, fire alarms, or the
feeling of lotion on the skin were described as causing intense distress, physical 
pain, and chronic anxiety. One parent described a haircut as so traumatic that it 
required physical restraint.

○ Trauma from Transitions and Change: Significant transitions (like graduating 

high school) and even routine changes (like autumn leaves falling) were 
described as having a traumatic impact due to a lack of internal and external 
resources to support adaptation.

○ Trauma from Social Confusion: Participants described a "chronic, damaging 
stress" resulting from the reduced ability to understand and predict others' 
intentions in social environments that do not provide direct communication. This 
led to self-blame, paranoia, and exhaustion.

● Feeling Trapped: Participants described trauma from being physically or 

psychologically trapped.

○ Physical Restraint and Sedation: Being held down or pharmacologically 

restrained was described as particularly traumatic due to the unpredictability of 
others' actions.

○ Loss of Autonomy and Scrutiny: Placement in institutions or overly restrictive 
therapeutic/educational environments where individuals felt intensely monitored, 
controlled, and "helpless" was identified as a source of trauma.

○ Loss of Opportunity: Trauma arose from being blocked from opportunities for 

learning and self-actualization, such as being segregated in school with 
inappropriately lowered academic goals. This created "chronic, diminished 
expectations for the future".

● Social Exclusion: Trauma was attributed to various forms of being kept apart from 

others and thwarted social belonging.

○ Bullying: Described as chronic, incessant, and inescapable, with its impact often

underestimated by others.

○ Social Isolation and Alienation: A prevailing feeling of social 

disconnectedness, described as being treated like "a space alien".

○ Traumatic Betrayal: Included not being believed when reporting maltreatment, 
but also feeling betrayed by a lack of directness and honesty from others, which 
clashed with a concrete interpretation of language.

Quotes We Might Use

● On Sensory Trauma: "He foams at the mouth at a haircut... we'd have to physically 
restrain him, it'd take an hour just to do a haircut... he talks about it even after it 
happened he couldn't get over it." (Denise, mother of a 5 yo son).

● On Trauma from Change: "I don't know how I pieced it together, but you know the 

leaves were falling off the tree! And it was disrupting to him. His whole life was disrupted 
at the age of four by leaves falling off of the tree." (Esther, mother of 22 yo son).
● On Feeling Trapped: "One time they almost killed me in seclusion by giving me, you 
know they shot me up with enough Haldol or something that made my blood pressure 
sink so low that when I stood up to leave the seclusion room I passed out." (Helen, 53 yo
woman).

● On Scrutiny: "Being constantly analyzed and forced into therapy in childhood. The 

feeling I described about special ed, feeling like I didn't have the same human rights as 
other people." (Karen, 40 yo woman).

● On Social Alienation: "I felt like everywhere I went I was just treated like I was a space 
alien yet nobody had a reason why, there was no explanation." (Lucy, 39 yo woman).
● On Bullying: "Well, it never ends, you know. They say it gets better but it never gets 
better, I just have adults bullying me now, you have coworkers or your boss or other 
people. It doesn't change. It's all the same." (William, 52 yo man).

Clinical Implications

This research has direct, urgent implications for clinical assessment and practice.

● Augment Checklists with Interviews: Standardized measures are not sufficient. 
Clinicians must use open-ended, qualitative inquiry to identify the full range of 
experiences an autistic person may find traumatic.

● Recognize Autism-Specific Traumas: Clinicians must be aware that experiences like 
sensory overload, routine changes, and social confusion can have a "traumatic or long-
lasting injurious effect" on autistic individuals. These experiences should not be 
dismissed.

● Understand Nuances: Clinicians need to understand how autism shapes the 

experience of traditional traumas. For example, a move to escape an abusive home may
itself be traumatic due to the change in routine or loss of a pet. Communication 
challenges can also add another layer of trauma when reporting abuse.

● Avoid Underestimation: Awareness of these themes can help ensure that the traumatic

experiences of autistic individuals are not "inappropriately discounted in case 
formulations" or in the development of treatments.
