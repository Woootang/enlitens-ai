The Neurological Basis for the "Narrative Self" or Self-Concept

1. Introduction

The "narrative self" refers to the sense of self that emerges from the integration of autobiographical memories, personal traits,

and life stories into a coherent identity over time. Neuroscientific research has identified a distributed network of brain regions
—most notably the default mode network (DMN), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and medial temporal lobe structures—as

central to the construction and maintenance of the narrative self and self-concept (Menon, 2023; Gibson, 2024; Young &

Saver, 2001; Koban et al., 2021; Levorsen et al., 2023; Frewen et al., 2020; Fingelkurts et al., 2020; Tisserand et al., 2023;

Gallagher, 2000; Martinelli et al., 2013). These regions support self-referential thought, autobiographical memory, and the

integration of personal meaning, allowing individuals to reflect on their past, imagine their future, and maintain a sense of

continuity and coherence. The narrative self is distinct from the "minimal" or "experiential" self, which is rooted in immediate,
embodied experience and is associated with networks such as the insula and salience network (Gibson, 2024; Tisserand et al.,

2023). Disruptions to these neural systems can lead to profound alterations in self-concept, as seen in neuropsychiatric and

neurodegenerative disorders (Young & Saver, 2001; Tisserand et al., 2023; Tisserand et al., 2020). This review synthesizes

current research on the neural underpinnings of the narrative self and self-concept.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic Scholar,

PubMed, and other databases. The search strategy targeted foundational theories, neural mechanisms, developmental and

clinical studies, and meta-analyses on the narrative self and self-concept. In total, 1016 papers were identified, 748 were

screened, 552 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1 The Default Mode Network (DMN) and Narrative Self

The DMN, comprising the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and angular gyrus, is consistently

activated during self-referential thought, autobiographical memory retrieval, and mind-wandering (Menon, 2023; Gibson,
2024; Koban et al., 2021; Frewen et al., 2020; Simony et al., 2016; Li et al., 2025; Gotlieb et al., 2024). The DMN integrates

memory, language, and semantic representations to create a coherent internal narrative, which is central to the construction

of the narrative self (Menon, 2023; Gibson, 2024; Koban et al., 2021; Frewen et al., 2020; Simony et al., 2016; Li et al., 2025;

Gotlieb et al., 2024). Disruptions in DMN connectivity are linked to disturbances in self-concept and narrative identity in

conditions such as schizophrenia and dementia (Young & Saver, 2001; Tisserand et al., 2023; Tisserand et al., 2020).

3.2 Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) and Self-Concept

The mPFC is a key hub for self-referential processing, representing the importance and centrality of personal traits and

experiences to one's self-concept (Levorsen et al., 2023; Romund et al., 2017; Martinelli et al., 2013). Activation in the mPFC is

observed during self-appraisal, reflection on personal attributes, and the evaluation of self-relevant information (Levorsen et
al., 2023; Romund et al., 2017; Martinelli et al., 2013). The mPFC also integrates social and emotional information, supporting

the development of a coherent and positive self-concept, especially during adolescence (Van Der Cruijsen et al., 2023;

Romund et al., 2017; Crone & Van Drunen, 2024; Crone et al., 2022).

3.3 Memory Systems and Narrative Construction

The medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, supports the encoding and retrieval of episodic and autobiographical

memories, which are the building blocks of the narrative self (Young & Saver, 2001; Baldassano et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2020;

Singer et al., 2013; Milivojevic et al., 2016; Martinelli et al., 2013). The interaction between the DMN and memory systems

enables the organization of life events into a temporally extended narrative, providing continuity and meaning (Menon, 2023;
Young & Saver, 2001; Baldassano et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2020; Singer et al., 2013; Milivojevic et al., 2016; Martinelli et al., 2013).

3.4 Additional Networks and Embodied Aspects

The insula and salience network contribute to the experiential or minimal self, grounding the narrative self in interoceptive and

embodied processes (Gibson, 2024; Monti et al., 2021; Tisserand et al., 2023). The integration of bodily signals with
autobiographical and conceptual information supports a unified sense of self across time and context (Gibson, 2024; Monti et

al., 2021; Tisserand et al., 2023).

4. Discussion

The narrative self and self-concept are supported by a distributed neural network, with the DMN and mPFC playing central

roles in integrating autobiographical memory, self-referential thought, and personal meaning (Menon, 2023; Gibson, 2024;

Koban et al., 2021; Levorsen et al., 2023; Frewen et al., 2020; Simony et al., 2016; Li et al., 2025; Gotlieb et al., 2024; Martinelli

et al., 2013). The mPFC encodes the importance of self-related information, while the DMN provides the infrastructure for

constructing a temporally extended, coherent self-narrative (Menon, 2023; Gibson, 2024; Koban et al., 2021; Levorsen et al.,

2023; Frewen et al., 2020; Simony et al., 2016; Li et al., 2025; Gotlieb et al., 2024; Martinelli et al., 2013). The medial temporal

lobe and hippocampus supply the episodic content that populates the narrative self (Young & Saver, 2001; Baldassano et al.,

2016; Lee et al., 2020; Singer et al., 2013; Milivojevic et al., 2016; Martinelli et al., 2013). The insula and salience network
ground the self in bodily and affective experience, linking the narrative and minimal selves (Gibson, 2024; Monti et al., 2021;

Tisserand et al., 2023).

Disruptions to these networks can fragment the narrative self, as seen in schizophrenia, dementia, and after focal brain injury

(Young & Saver, 2001; Tisserand et al., 2023; Tisserand et al., 2020). Developmental studies show that the neural basis of self-

concept evolves through adolescence, with increasing integration and coherence supported by mPFC and DMN maturation
(Van Der Cruijsen et al., 2023; Crone & Van Drunen, 2024; Crone et al., 2022). The narrative self is also shaped by social,

cultural, and environmental factors, which interact with neural systems to scaffold identity (Heersmink, 2018; Heersmink,

2020; Heersmink, 2016; Heersmink, 2022).

5. Conclusion

The neurological basis of the narrative self and self-concept is rooted in the default mode network, medial prefrontal cortex,

and memory systems, which together enable the integration of autobiographical memory, self-reflection, and personal

meaning. These networks provide the infrastructure for constructing a coherent, temporally extended sense of self, while

embodied and social processes further shape identity across the lifespan.

5.1 Research Gaps

Key gaps include the precise mechanisms linking narrative construction to neural dynamics, the interplay between narrative

and minimal selves, and the impact of culture and technology on neural self-representation.

5.2 Open Research Questions

Future research should clarify the dynamic interactions between neural networks, memory, and embodiment in self-

construction, and explore how social and technological changes reshape the narrative self.

Question

Why

How do dynamic interactions between the DMN, mPFC, and memory
systems construct and update the narrative self in real time?

Understanding this will clarify the neural basis of
self-continuity and identity change.

What are the neural mechanisms linking the narrative and
minimal/embodied selves?

This will illuminate how immediate experience and
autobiographical narrative are integrated.

How do culture, technology, and social context shape the neural
representation of the narrative self?

This is crucial for understanding self-concept in a
rapidly changing world.

FIGURE  Key open questions for advancing research on the neural basis of the narrative self.

In summary, the narrative self and self-concept are constructed by a distributed neural network—anchored in the DMN,

mPFC, and memory systems—that integrates autobiographical memory, self-reflection, and embodied experience into a

coherent sense of identity.
