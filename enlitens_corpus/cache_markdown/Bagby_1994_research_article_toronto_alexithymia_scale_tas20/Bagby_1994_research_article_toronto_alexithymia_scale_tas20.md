DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is the foundational research article by Bagby, Parker, and Taylor (1994) 
detailing the development and validation of the twenty-item Toronto Alexithymia 
Scale (TAS-20). The paper outlines the process of revising the original TAS to address 
psychometric shortcomings. Through two studies with both nonclinical and clinical 
samples, the authors establish the TAS-20 as a reliable and valid self-report measure of
alexithymia. The research confirms a stable three-factor structure for the construct: (1) 
difficulty identifying feelings, (2) difficulty describing feelings, and (3) externally-oriented 
thinking.

THE TWENTY-ITEM TORONTO ALEXITHYMIA SCALE—I. 
ITEM SELECTION AND CROSS-VALIDATION OF THE 
FACTOR STRUCTURE

R. MICHAEL BAGBY, James D. A. PARKER, and GRAEME J. TAYLOR

Abstract

Addressing shortcomings of the self-report Toronto Alexithymia Scale 
(TAS), two studies were conducted to reconstruct the item domain of the 
scale. The first study resulted in the development of a new twenty-item 
version of the scale—the TAS-20. The TAS-20 demonstrated good internal 
consistency and test-retest reliability, and a three-factor structure 
theoretically congruent with the alexithymia construct. The stability and 
replicability of this three-factor structure were demonstrated in the second 
study with both clinical and nonclinical populations by the use of 
confirmatory factor analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Formulated during the early 1970s, the alexithymia construct is generating increasing 
interest as a possible personality risk factor for a variety of psychiatric and 
psychosomatic disorders. Investigations of alexithymia have been hampered, however,
by problems with the various instruments designed to measure the construct.

Recognizing that previous self-report alexithymia scales were developed without 
concern for construct validation, the authors developed the original twenty-six item 
Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). Though an improvement, several shortcomings of 
the original TAS became apparent, including high correlation between factors and poor 
theoretical coherency of the "reduced daydreaming" factor. These issues prompted a 
re-examination and revision of the scale.

AIMS

The aims of this research were: (1) to extract a new set of items from an expanded item 
pool; (2) to cross-validate the factor structure of the revised scale with both clinical and 
non-clinical samples; and (3) to assess the convergent, discriminant, and concurrent 
validity of the revised scale. This first paper covers the first two aims.

STUDY 1: ITEM SELECTION AND SCALE REDEVELOPMENT

Method

A pool of forty-three items (the original 26 TAS items plus 17 new items) was 
administered to 965 undergraduate students. Items were systematically eliminated if 
they had a high correlation with social desirability, low item-total correlations, or did not 
load significantly and uniquely on one of three rotated factors in an exploratory factor 
analysis.

Results

All items directly assessing imaginal activity (daydreaming) were eliminated because of 
low internal consistency or high correlations with social desirability. This process 
resulted in a final 20-item scale, the TAS-20.

Factor analysis of the TAS-20 yielded three interpretable factors that are congruent with
the theoretical construct of alexithymia:

● Factor 1: Difficulty Identifying Feelings: Comprised of items assessing the 
capacity to identify feelings and distinguish them from the bodily sensations of 
emotional arousal.

● Factor 2: Difficulty Describing Feelings: Reflects the inability to communicate 

feelings to other people.

● Factor 3: Externally-Oriented Thinking: Comprised entirely of items assessing 

this cognitive style.

The TAS-20 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81) 
and good test-retest reliability over 3 weeks (r = 0.77).

STUDY 2: CROSS-VALIDATION OF THE THREE-FACTOR 
STRUCTURE

Method

The three-factor structure derived from Study 1 was tested using confirmatory factor 
analysis in separate samples of 401 university students and 218 psychiatric out-
patients.

Results

The goodness-of-fit indices (GFI, AGFI, RMS) for the three-factor model met the criteria 
standards for both the student sample and the psychiatric out-patient sample, signifying 
an adequate fit.

Results indicated that the three factor solution was better able to reproduce 
the data than the unidimensional model for both the university student 
sample and the psychiatric out-patient sample.

Furthermore, the three-factor solution provided a significantly better fit to the data than a
two-factor model where the first two factors were combined.

DISCUSSION

The TAS-20 was developed to surmount the shortcomings of the original TAS. The 
results of these two studies indicate that the three-factor structure of the TAS-20 is 
stable and replicable across clinical and nonclinical populations.

Factor 1 correlates strongly with Factor 2, which is expected since the ability 
to communicate feelings is obviously contingent on an ability to recognize 
one's own affects. Similarly, Factors 2 and 3 are correlated, as an externally-
oriented cognitive style contains little or no reference to a person's inner 
feelings. Together Factors 2 and 3 appear to reflect the pensée opératoire 
aspect of the alexithymia construct, namely, a cognitive style that shows a 
preference for the external details of everyday life rather than thought 
content related to feelings, fantasies, and other aspects of a person's inner 
experience.

The high coefficient alphas obtained for the full TAS-20 across samples indicate 
excellent internal consistency of the revised scale, representing an improvement over 
the original TAS. While the initial evidence of reliability and factorial validity of the TAS-
20 is encouraging, other kinds of evidence (presented in a subsequent paper) are 
needed to show that the scale measures the alexithymia construct in an adequate way.
