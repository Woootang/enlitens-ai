DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This special report from the New England Journal of Medicine describes the "All of Us" 
Research Program, a massive, federally-funded initiative to build a health research cohort of at 
least one million people in the United States. It is critically relevant to Enlitens because it 
explicitly states that past medical research has been hindered by a lack of diversity, leading to 
decreased generalizability and incorrect interpretations. The program's core mission to recruit a 
cohort that reflects the diversity of the U.S.—with over 80% of its initial participants from groups 
historically underrepresented in research—provides powerful, large-scale validation for Enlitens'
argument against using narrow, non-representative data (like that from standardized tests) to 
make judgments about individuals.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Many of these cohorts, however, are small, lack diversity, or do not provide 

comprehensive phenotype data."

● "More than 80% of these participants are from groups that have been historically 

underrepresented in biomedical research."

● "However, many efforts have been hampered by an inadequate sample size and a lack 
of diversity among participants,¹ restrictive policies regarding data access, or failure to 
capture genotype and phenotype data comprehensively."

● "Collectively, these challenges have slowed the pace of medical discovery, decreased 
the generalizability of research findings, hindered reproducibility, and led to incorrect 
interpretations."

● "Population-based research, which requires large sample sizes and highly granular 

phenotypic data, benefits from access to populations of patients from various 
ancestries."

● "The All of Us Research Program seeks to recruit persons in demographic categories 
that have been and continue to be underrepresented in biomedical research; such 
persons typically have relatively poor access to good health care."

● "Race, ethnic group, age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, 

access to care, income, educational attainment, and geographic location are therefore 
taken into account."

● "Because racial and ethnic identities are more than a genetic construct, we seek to 

capture other social and behavioral determinants of health."

● "EHR data can be fragmented, incomplete, and inaccurate 32,36; however, in certain 
contexts, such data have already proved to be a powerful and efficient discovery tool."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Program Goal: To enroll a diverse group of at least 1 million persons in the United 

States.

● Recruitment Status (as of July 2019): More than 175,000 participants had contributed 

biospecimens , and more than 230,000 total participants were enrolled.

● Diversity Statistics (as of July 2019):

○ More than 80% of the 175,000 participants who contributed biospecimens are 

from groups historically underrepresented in biomedical research.

○ Among core participants, 51% are nonwhite.
○ Among core participants, 80% meet the program's definition of being 

underrepresented in biomedical research.

● Diversity Recruitment Targets:

○ The target percentage of persons in racial and ethnic minorities is more than 

45%.

○ The target percentage of persons in underrepresented populations is more than 

75%.

● EHR Data Collection (as of July 2019): EHR data on more than 112,000 participants 

from 34 sites have been collected.

● Recruitment Rate: Approximately 3100 core participants per week.
● Projected Goal Completion: Expects to have enrolled 1 million core participants by 

approximately 2024.

● Projected Genetic Findings:

○ An estimated 30,000 persons will receive actionable findings for ACMG genes.
○ More than 90% of participants may learn of actionable pharmacogenomic 

variants.

● Funding: As of 2015, Congress has allocated $1.02 billion to the program, with the 21st 

Century Cures Act authorizing an additional $1.14 billion through 2026.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

The All of Us Research Program utilizes a comprehensive protocol designed for large-scale, 
longitudinal data collection from a diverse population.

● Recruitment and Consent:

○ Participants must be 18 years or older with the capacity to provide informed 
consent. Protocols are in development to include children, adolescents, and 
cognitively impaired persons.

○ Enrollment occurs digitally through a website or smartphone app.
○ The consent process includes explanatory videos with brief text, iconography, 
and formative questions to ensure understanding. All content is targeted to a 
fifth-grade reading level and is available in English and Spanish.

○ Recruitment happens through a network of over 340 sites, including health care 
provider organizations (regional medical centers, federally qualified health 
centers, Veterans Health Administration) and a "direct-volunteer" route for those 
unaffiliated with these centers.

● Data Collection Elements: The program gathers multiple streams of data.

○ Health Surveys: Initial surveys cover sociodemographics, overall health, 

lifestyle, and substance use. Subsequent modules cover personal and family 
medical history and access to health care. All survey questions were evaluated 
with cognitive and online testing in diverse populations before use.

○ Electronic Health Records (EHRs): With participant authorization, the program 
captures structured data including billing codes, medication history, laboratory 
results, vital signs, and encounter records. This will be expanded to include 
narrative documents. Data is structured according to a common data model.
○ Physical Measurements: Per-protocol measurements include blood pressure, 
heart rate, weight, height, body-mass index, and hip and waist circumferences.
○ Biospecimens: Blood and urine samples are collected for DNA, RNA, cell-free 
DNA, serum, and plasma. If blood cannot be obtained, saliva specimens are 
used.

○ Digital Health Technology: Participants can share data from compatible 
devices like Fitbit. The program plans to expand support for other devices.
○ Future Data Sources: The program plans to link to other datasets like national 
death indexes, pharmacy data, health care claims data, and geospatially linked 
environmental data (weather, air quality, etc.).

● Data Access for Researchers:

○ To promote broad access and avoid long delays, the program uses a cloud-

based environment where approved researchers can use web-based tools to 
analyze data without downloading it.

○ The program uses a "passport model," where researchers are approved for data 
access to study any topic that meets the criterion for allowable use, rather than 
requiring project-specific applications.

○ All identifying information is removed from participant data available to 

researchers.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

This document describes the methodology for recruiting diverse populations rather than 
presenting research findings about them. The core of the program's design is to intentionally 
include groups that have been historically underrepresented, making the methodology itself a 
key finding for Enlitens.

● Focus on Underrepresented Groups: "The All of Us Research Program seeks to 
recruit persons in demographic categories that have been and continue to be 

underrepresented in biomedical research; such persons typically have relatively poor 
access to good health care."

● Broad Definition of Diversity: "Race, ethnic group, age, sex, gender identity, sexual 
orientation, disability status, access to care, income, educational attainment, and 
geographic location are therefore taken into account."

● Prioritization: "Persons in underrepresented populations who are enrolled in the 

program will be prioritized for physical measurements and biospecimen collections."

● Beyond Genetics: "Because racial and ethnic identities are more than a genetic 
construct, we seek to capture other social and behavioral determinants of health."
● Community Engagement: The program has funded a network of 22 community 
partners to engage diverse populations and providers, guided by pilot studies.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

The practical application for Enlitens is the program's model for comprehensive, multi-modal 
data collection, which stands in stark contrast to the single data point of a standardized test. The
types of data collected provide a blueprint for what a holistic assessment could entail.
