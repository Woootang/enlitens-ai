Yes, using analogies and metaphors generally improves learning and retention of
scientific concepts, especially for abstract or complex topics, though their
effectiveness depends on quality, context, and instructional support.

1. Introduction

Analogies and metaphors are widely used in science education to bridge the gap between unfamiliar scientific

concepts and students’ prior knowledge or everyday experiences. Decades of research show that well-constructed

analogies can enhance understanding, facilitate inferential reasoning, and improve retention of complex scientific

ideas across educational levels and disciplines (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998; A. & A., 2022; Gray & Holyoak, 2021;

Yanowitz, 2001; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Dagher, 1995; Keri & Elbatarny, 2021; Treagust et al., 1996; Treagust, 2016; Stavy,

1991; Sezer & Karataş, 2022). However, their effectiveness is influenced by factors such as the learner’s prior

knowledge, the quality and familiarity of the analogy, and the instructional context (Donnelly & McDaniel, 1993;

Jaeger et al., 2016; Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Niebert et al., 2012; Braasch & Goldman, 2010; Treagust et al., 1996; Xue

et al., 2022; H., 2020; Orgill & Thomas, 2007; Orgill & Bodner, 2004). While analogies can sometimes lead to

misconceptions if not carefully chosen or explained, the consensus is that, when used thoughtfully, they are

powerful tools for promoting meaningful learning and engagement in science (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998; A. & A.,

2022; Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Yanowitz, 2001; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Dagher, 1995; Keri & Elbatarny, 2021; Treagust et al.,

1996; Treagust, 2016; Stavy, 1991; Sezer & Karataş, 2022).

2. Methods

This review synthesized evidence from a Deep Search of over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The search strategy targeted studies on analogies, metaphors, learning, and

retention in science education, spanning foundational theory, empirical research, and instructional practice. Out of

1,028 identified papers, 794 were screened, 633 met eligibility criteria, and the 50 most relevant papers were

included in this review.

3.1 Effects on Learning and Retention

Numerous experimental and classroom studies demonstrate that analogies and metaphors can significantly

improve students’ understanding and retention of scientific concepts, especially when the target material is

abstract or complex (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998; A. & A., 2022; Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Yanowitz, 2001; Chiu & Lin,

2005; Dagher, 1995; Keri & Elbatarny, 2021; Treagust et al., 1996; Treagust, 2016; Stavy, 1991; Sezer & Karataş,

2022). For example, analogy-enhanced texts and lessons have been shown to boost both immediate and delayed

recall, as well as inferential reasoning, compared to literal or non-analogical instruction (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998;

Yanowitz, 2001; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Vosniadou & Skopeliti, 2018; Treagust et al., 1996; Stavy, 1991; Diehl & Reese,

2010; Vieira & Morais, 2022). Students often report greater confidence and engagement when analogies are used

(Bernard & Spencer, 2023; Keri & Elbatarny, 2021; Vieira & Morais, 2025; Vieira & Morais, 2022).

3.2 Mechanisms and Moderators

Analogies work by mapping familiar, concrete schemas onto new, abstract domains, making the unfamiliar more

accessible and memorable (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998; Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Niebert et al., 2012; Dagher, 1995;
Treagust et al., 1996; Treagust, 2016; Diehl & Reese, 2010; H., 2020). Their effectiveness is moderated by:

•

•

•

Learner characteristics: Novices, students with low prior knowledge, and those with learning difficulties

benefit most (Donnelly & McDaniel, 1993; Jaeger et al., 2016; Yanowitz, 2001; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Al-Dhaimata et

al., 2022).

Quality and familiarity: Analogies that are well-mapped, familiar, and explicitly discussed are more effective

(Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Niebert et al., 2012; Harrison & Treagust, 1993; Petchey et al., 2023; Treagust et al., 1996;

Treagust, 2016; H., 2020; Orgill & Thomas, 2007).

Instructional context: Active engagement, elaboration, and teacher guidance enhance benefits and reduce

misconceptions (McDaniel & Donnelly, 1996; Iding, 1997; Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Petchey et al., 2023; Cameron,

2002; Treagust et al., 1996; Treagust, 2016; Orgill & Thomas, 2007; Orgill & Bodner, 2004).

3.3 Limitations and Potential Pitfalls

While analogies can foster conceptual change and correct misconceptions, poorly chosen or superficially mapped

analogies may reinforce misunderstandings or create new ones (Gilbert, 1989; Niebert et al., 2012; Harrison &

Treagust, 1993; Cameron, 2002; Duit et al., 2001; Xue et al., 2022; Negrea-Busuioc et al., 2022; H., 2020; Rodriguez

et al., 2025). Some studies report no effect or even negative effects if analogies are not well aligned with students’
prior knowledge or if their limitations are not made explicit (Donnelly & McDaniel, 1993; Gilbert, 1989; Niebert et

al., 2012; Harrison & Treagust, 1993; Cameron, 2002; Duit et al., 2001; Xue et al., 2022; Negrea-Busuioc et al., 2022;

H., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2025).

3.4 Disciplinary and Contextual Variability

Analogies and metaphors are effective across science disciplines (biology, chemistry, physics, engineering) and

educational levels, but their impact can vary by topic and context (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998; A. & A., 2022; Gray &
Holyoak, 2021; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Keri & Elbatarny, 2021; Aubusson et al., 2009; Treagust, 2016; Stavy, 1991; Xue et

al., 2022; H., 2020; Sezer & Karataş, 2022). For highly abstract or counterintuitive concepts, analogies are

especially valuable, but they must be carefully selected and scaffolded (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998; Gray & Holyoak,
2021; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Keri & Elbatarny, 2021; Aubusson et al., 2009; Treagust, 2016; Stavy, 1991; Xue et al., 2022;

H., 2020; Sezer & Karataş, 2022).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports the use of analogies and metaphors as effective tools for improving learning and

retention of scientific concepts, particularly for abstract or complex topics (Glynn & Takahashi, 1998; A. & A., 2022;

Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Yanowitz, 2001; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Dagher, 1995; Keri & Elbatarny, 2021; Treagust et al., 1996;

Treagust, 2016; Stavy, 1991; Sezer & Karataş, 2022). Their power lies in connecting new information to familiar

knowledge structures, making science more accessible and memorable. However, their effectiveness depends on

thoughtful selection, explicit mapping, and instructional support to avoid misconceptions (Gray & Holyoak, 2021;
Niebert et al., 2012; Harrison & Treagust, 1993; Petchey et al., 2023; Treagust et al., 1996; Treagust, 2016; H., 2020;

Orgill & Thomas, 2007; Orgill & Bodner, 2004). While some studies report null or negative effects, these are

typically associated with poor analogy choice, lack of scaffolding, or misalignment with students’ prior knowledge

(Donnelly & McDaniel, 1993; Gilbert, 1989; Niebert et al., 2012; Harrison & Treagust, 1993; Cameron, 2002; Duit et

al., 2001; Xue et al., 2022; Negrea-Busuioc et al., 2022; H., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2025).

Best practices include using familiar, well-mapped analogies, discussing both their strengths and limitations, and

actively engaging students in generating or critiquing analogies (Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Niebert et al., 2012; Petchey

et al., 2023; Treagust et al., 1996; Treagust, 2016; H., 2020; Orgill & Thomas, 2007; Orgill & Bodner, 2004).

Analogies are most beneficial for novices and learners with less background knowledge, but can also deepen

understanding for advanced students when used to highlight structural relationships or foster conceptual change
(Donnelly & McDaniel, 1993; Jaeger et al., 2016; Gray & Holyoak, 2021; Yanowitz, 2001; Chiu & Lin, 2005; Al-

Dhaimata et al., 2022).

5. Conclusion

Analogies and metaphors are powerful, evidence-based tools for improving learning and retention of scientific
concepts, especially when used thoughtfully and with instructional support. Their effectiveness is greatest for

abstract or complex topics and for learners with less prior knowledge, but care must be taken to avoid

misconceptions.

5.1 Research Gaps
