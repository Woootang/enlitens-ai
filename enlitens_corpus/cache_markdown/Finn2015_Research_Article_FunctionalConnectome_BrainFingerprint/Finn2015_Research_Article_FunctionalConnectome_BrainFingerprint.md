DOCUMENT SUMMARY This foundational 2015 study proves that every individual has a 
unique and reliable pattern of brain connectivity—a "functional connectome fingerprint"—that 
can be used to identify them with near-perfect accuracy from fMRI scans. The research 
demonstrates that this fingerprint is an intrinsic property, stable across different mental states 
(task vs. rest). Critically, the study shows these unique brain patterns are not just noise; they are
behaviorally meaningful and can predict a person's level of fluid intelligence, providing powerful 
evidence for the "no normal brain" paradigm.

Functional connectome fingerprinting: 
Identifying individuals based on patterns 
of brain connectivity

Why This Matters to Enlitens

This paper is the scientific bedrock for our "no normal brain" philosophy. It provides definitive, 
data-driven proof that every person's functional brain wiring is unique and stable, much like a 
fingerprint. This directly challenges the traditional scientific and clinical approach of averaging 
data and comparing individuals to a population norm—an approach we know is fundamentally 
flawed.

By showing that these unique "brain fingerprints" are not just random noise but are directly 
related to cognitive abilities like fluid intelligence, this research validates our entire approach. It 
provides a scientific foundation for individualized assessment, dimensional understanding of 
abilities, and the search for strengths-based "neuromarkers." This is a landmark study we can 
cite to argue that the future of mental health and neuroscience lies in understanding the 
individual, not the average.

Critical Statistics for Our Work

The study analyzed fMRI data from 126 healthy adults from the Human Connectome Project.

Identification Accuracy

● Rest-to-Rest Identification: Using only the frontoparietal networks, individuals could be
identified from one resting-state scan to another with 98-99% accuracy. Using the 
whole-brain connectome, accuracy was 93-94%.

● Rest-to-Task Identification: Accuracy remained highly significant, typically between 80-
90%, when identifying an individual from a resting-state scan to a task scan (or vice-
versa).

● Statistical Significance: Permutation testing showed that the highest success rate 

achievable by chance was about 5%. The actual results are therefore highly significant 
(p=0).

● Most Distinctive Network: The frontoparietal network was the most successful for 

individual identification.

Behavioral Prediction

● Using a predictive model, an individual's unique connectivity profile could predict their 

score on a fluid intelligence (gF) test.

● The correlation between predicted gF scores and observed gF scores was

 r = 0.50 (p<10e−9), demonstrating strong predictive power.

● The same networks that were most discriminating of individuals (frontoparietal) were 

also the most predictive of their cognitive behavior.

Methodology We Can Learn From

● Connectome Fingerprinting: This is the core method. For each person, a 268x268 
matrix representing the connection strength (correlation) between 268 brain nodes is 
created. To identify a person, their "target" matrix from one scan session is correlated 
against a "database" of matrices from all subjects from a different session. The identity is
predicted to be the subject with the highest correlation.

● Cross-Validation for Prediction: To test if connectomes could predict behavior, the 

study used a robust leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. A model is trained on all 
subjects except one to find brain connections that correlate with fluid intelligence. That 
model is then used to predict the gF score for the one "left out" subject. Repeating this 
for every subject ensures the model can generalize to new, unseen individuals.

Findings That Challenge the System

● Direct Challenge to Group-Average Research: This paper's central finding directly 

refutes the standard neuroimaging practice of averaging brain data across many people.
It proves that individual variability, often treated as noise, is actually a rich and highly 
reliable signal.

● The Individual Is the Signal: The study establishes that "functional connectivity profiles
act as an identifying 'fingerprint,' proving that individual variability in connectivity is both 
substantial and reproducible".

● Brain Organization is Intrinsic and Stable: The ability to identify a person across 
different brain states (rest vs. task) demonstrates that the fingerprint arises from an 
underlying, intrinsic functional architecture that is unique to each person.

● Higher-Order Networks Drive Individuality: The most unique and personally 

identifying features were not in primary sensory or motor areas, but in the higher-order 

association cortices of the frontoparietal network. These are the same areas that are 
most evolutionarily recent and involved in flexible, complex cognition.

Populations Discussed

● The study was conducted on a sample of 126 healthy adults, aged 22 to 35, from the 

Human Connectome Project.

● While the paper focuses on a healthy population, its findings on the fundamental 
uniqueness of brain organization are universally applicable and provide a critical 
baseline for studying neurodivergent populations.

● The authors explicitly state that their work suggests new insights into neuropsychiatric 

illnesses may be gained by examining individual connectivity profiles rather than relying 
on group-level inferences.

Quotes We Might Use

● "We are all unique individuals. Nevertheless, human neuroimaging studies have 
traditionally collapsed data from many subjects to draw inferences about general 
patterns of brain activity that are common across people."

● "...functional connectivity profiles act as a 'fingerprint' that can accurately identify 

subjects from a large group."

● "...an individual's connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish that 

individual regardless of how the brain is engaged during imaging."

● "...the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive."
● "...the same networks that were most discriminating of individuals were also most 

predictive of cognitive behavior."

● "Results indicate the potential to draw inferences about single subjects based on 

functional connectivity fMRI."

● "...human neuroimaging studies have an opportunity to move beyond population-level 
inferences... to inferences about single subjects, examining how individuals' networks 
are functionally organized in unique ways and relating this functional organization to 
behavioral phenotypes..."

Clinical Implications

● This work provides a critical foundation for developing "fMRI-based connectivity 

'neuromarkers' of present or future behavior that may eventually be used to personalize 
educational and clinical practices, improving outcomes".

● The study suggests that research on neuropsychiatric conditions may have 
compromised sensitivity when relying only on group-level comparisons.

● It supports a shift away from single diagnostic labels and toward an approach that links 
individual, dimensional measures of brain connectivity to a spectrum of behaviors and 
symptoms , which is highly aligned with frameworks like RDoC.
