DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper by Dr. Laurent Mottron presents a powerful critique of dominant early intervention 
methods for autism, such as Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI) and Applied 
Behavioral Analysis (ABA). Mottron argues these deficit-based, normative models are ethically 
questionable, lack robust evidence, and fail to respect autistic learning styles and strengths. 
This document is core to Enlitens' mission because it provides a comprehensive, parallel 
argument against the philosophy underpinning standardized testing: instead of trying to "fix" 
deficits to match a neurotypical norm (the goal of ABA), we should adopt a strengths-based 
approach that presumes competence and supports alternative developmental pathways.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Once considered to be 'scientifically proven', the efficacy of these approaches has been
called into question in the last decade due to poor-quality data, small effects, low cost-
efficiency, and the evolution of ethical and societal standards."

● "The assumption that autistic children do not learn by themselves is clearly untrue. 

Implicit learning has repeatedly been demonstrated in autistic individuals and is actually 
slowed down by explicit instructions."

● "The aims of autism science are still normative and normocentric, from suppressing 

autism itself to mimicking non-autistic social behavior."

● "As highlighted by autistic adults, autism is part of the human condition and is here to 

stay, despite the triumphalism of some scientists."

● "The purpose of educational and child psychiatry interventions should rather be to allow 
the individual to achieve an abstract level of happiness, personal accomplishment, 
access to cultural material, and social integration, an essential human right, regardless 
of the way in which this is achieved and the form that it takes."

● "There is currently no scientific, ethical, or societal justification for EIBI."

CRITIQUE OF DEFICIT-BASED 
INTERVENTION (EIBI/ABA)

Questioning the Efficacy and Ethics of EIBI/ABA

● "The Author(s) 2017. This article is published with open access at [suspicious link 

removed] Abstract Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) and its recent variant, 
naturalist developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI) aim to increase socialization and
communication, and to decrease repetitive and challenging behaviors in preschool age 
autistic children." "These behaviorist techniques are based on the precocity and intensity
of the intervention, face-to-face interaction, errorless learning, and information 
fragmentation." "Once considered to be 'scientifically proven', the efficacy of these 
approaches has been called into question in the last decade due to poor-quality data, 
small effects, low cost-efficiency, and the evolution of ethical and societal standards."

Core Principles of EIBI/ABA

● "...the various currents of EIBI display a considerable overlap in terms of the techniques 
used and the underlying principles: precocity (the earlier the intervention is applied, the 
more effective it is likely to be), intensity (more intensive interventions are preferred, with
as many as 25 h/week frequently recommended), highly structured and constantly 
monitored interventions, normativity (the less autistic the child is at the end of the 
intervention, the more successful the intervention is considered to have been), task-
decomposition (information to be learned is broken down), the use of external or natural 
reinforcement, and extinction procedures."

● "Intervention targets map the definition of a combination of negative socio-

communicative symptoms ('lack' or limitation of socially oriented behaviors) and positive,
non-social symptoms (an 'excess' of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors)." "EIBI 
aims to render this bumpy profile flat and less autistic: increase prerequisites of typical 
socially oriented behaviors and communication, while suppressing repetitive behaviors 
and autistic interests."

Scientific Backlash

● "However, the early twenty-first century has seen the emergence of critics of EIBI." "An 

influential autism research expert [13] questioned the presuppositions and ethical issues 
related to EIBI, and criticized the use of low standards in autism intervention research." 
"Its underlying principles and targets, the empirical demonstration of its efficacy, its cost-
efficiency, and ethical justification are now widely questioned ([22]; see [40] for a 
review)."

● "The NICE guide highlights the limited nature of the changes that can be unambiguously 
attributed to the intervention itself. One of the major conclusions of this guide is that the 
quality of intervention research has been low or very low, and that it is therefore not 
possible to recommend ABA, or, more generally, EIBI."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Critique of the "Prerequisite" Model

The author argues that forcing autistic children to master neurotypical developmental 
prerequisites (like eye contact) is flawed because autistic development follows a different, 
equally valid, pathway.

● "A dubious intervention target: prerequisites of learning and typical social functioning... 

This notion of a 'prerequisite' implies that the typical, non-autistic early manifestations of 
the targeted function must be mastered before the autistic child can develop more 
complex, or mature non-autistic behaviors."

● "The assumption that not reaching a developmental milestone at the age at which it is 
typically attained precludes the further development of a given function may, however, 
not be valid if the trainee follows a specific developmental route which does not cross 
typical prerequisites."

● "We favor the view that autistic people follow a different pathway through the 

developmental sequences that result in maturation and social and language acquisition."

● "Metaphorically, more puppies than kittens swim, but training a cat to swim at a young 

age will not make that cat any more like a dog as an adult."

Understanding Autistic Language Development

The author posits that autistic language acquisition often follows a non-social, non-linear 
pathway, which traditional interventions ignore.

● "In prototypical autism... the developmental sequence of autistic speech follows a 

'bayonet'-shaped pathway." "After the unremarkable acquisition of a handful of words at 
approximately 18 months of age, speech development appears to halt, reaching a 
plateau, or even regressing."

● "In most cases [67], this non-verbal plateau is followed by relatively rapid, but atypical, 
speech development at the age of about 40–60 months, including immediate and 
delayed echolalia and pronoun reversals ('you' for 'I')."

● "...the reduced sequence of communicative overtures-delayed echolalia enhanced 
decoding abilities-speech delay-late attainment of functional speech, suggests that 
autistic children mostly learn language in a non-communicative manner."

● "The normocentric, step-by-step, prerequisite approach of classical ABA to the prosthetic

construction of language should be abandoned."

A Strengths-Based View of Repetitive Behaviors (RIRBs)

Instead of viewing RIRBs as deficits to be eliminated, the author reframes them as 
manifestations of autistic intelligence, interest, and information-seeking.

● "We developed the 'enhanced perceptual functioning' (EPF) model to account for unique
aspects of autistic perception." "One of the main proposals emanating from this model is 
that perception influences overt behavior and contributes to intelligence to a much 
greater extent in autistic than non-autistic individuals."

● "Some RIRBs (e.g., an early interest in letters, staring at objects for longer) are, thus, 

manifestations of sophisticated information processing..."

● "The way in which most RIRBs continue to be seen in intervention programs is 

exemplified by their grouping with 'problematic' behaviors in intervention studies, even 
being viewed as a justification for punishment [37]."

● "Our position is that they should be encouraged and nurtured, as they are manifestation 
of interest in all children." "We feel that it is unjustified to try to eliminate manifestations 
of interest, even if these RIRBs are 'obsessive'."

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

Underestimation of Autistic Intelligence

The paper argues that intellectual disability is often conflated with prototypical autism due to 
biased, language-loaded assessment instruments, supporting the need for alternative, 
strengths-based evaluation.

● "Prediction 1: intellectual disability is associated with syndromic autism, not prototypical 

autism."

● "It is frequently overlooked that Kanner discarded intellectual disability in his first group 

of 11 autistic children, for whom he reported indices of normal intelligence."

● "The early measurement of intelligence in institutionalized adults [33] resulted in most 

being found to have an intellectual disability when tested with verbally loaded 
instruments. Even the non-verbal subscales of these instruments can yield deceptive 
results, as the instructions given are also heavily language-loaded [14]."

● "Our group has provided substantial evidence that intelligence is 'at risk of being 

underestimated' in young non-verbal autistic individuals [11]."

● "Reported rates of intellectual disability in autism vary by approximately 40% between 

US states providing data (Utah: 20%; South Carolina: 60%; [9])." "This suggests that the 
proportion of autistic individuals with intellectual disability cannot be accurately 
determined with the instruments currently used for its measurement."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS (A 
STRENGTHS-BASED MODEL)

The author proposes five testable predictions that form the basis of a strengths-based 
educational model for autism, providing a framework that Enlitens can adapt for its assessment 
philosophy.

1. Presume Competence: "intellectual disability is associated with syndromic autism, not 
prototypical autism." The model assumes normal non-verbal intelligence is the default in 
non-syndromic autism and that assessment tools must be adapted to reveal this 
competence.

2. Support Autistic Learning Styles: "favoring access to written verbal material and 

auditory non-communicative language should favor the long-term development of 

speech." This involves providing materials like subtitles, keyboards, and audio tapes, 
respecting that autistic children may learn language non-communicatively first.

3. Value and Utilize Interests (RIRBs): "including periods of free access to material of 
'special interest' in the child's time-schedule will decrease 'captivity' RIRBs, and 
problematic behaviors." This reframes RIRBs as information-seeking behaviors that 
should be nurtured and integrated into a child's education, not suppressed.

4. Promote "Lateral Tutorship": "lateral tutorship of autistic preschoolers in natural 
parental and daycare settings improves the well-being of parents and school age 
children more than early, personalized, professional, face-to-face intervention." This 
involves an adult engaging in a shared interest in parallel with the child, fostering social 
bonding through that interest rather than through forced neurotypical social routines.
5. Prioritize Inclusion and On-Site Support: "inclusion in regular, but supervised daycare

centers and parental support, associated with on-site crisis solving, is a more cost-
effective educational intervention than EIBI/NDBI." This argues against segregated, 
intensive therapy in favor of inclusion in natural environments with support provided as 
needed, which is less costly and more beneficial for social integration.
