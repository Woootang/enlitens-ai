DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This landmark editorial by Simon Baron-Cohen argues for a revolutionary shift from viewing 
autism as a "disorder" to embracing it as a form of "neurodiversity." He systematically 
dismantles the "disorder" label by presenting evidence from genetics, neuroscience, and 
cognition that points to "difference" rather than "dysfunction." The paper provides clear 
definitions for the terms disorder, disease, disability, and difference, advocating for a more 
balanced, respectful, and strengths-based framework that has profound implications for 
psychiatry, clinical practice, and human rights. This text is a foundational manifesto for Enlitens' 
entire mission.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

"This editorial focuses on the question of whether autism is properly characterised as a disorder 
and whether the neurodiversity framework should be embraced."

"But when we examine the cognition and biology of autism, arguably what we see is not 
evidence of dysfunction but rather evidence of difference."

"Aspects of social cognition reflect areas of disability in autism, and if a person is not showing 
any sign of disability, he or she would not warrant a diagnosis. But the language of disability is 
very different to the language of disorder. Disability requires societal support, acceptance of 
difference and diversity, and societal ‘reasonable adjustment’, while disorder is usually taken to 
require cure or treatment. These are very different frameworks."

"Steve Silberman's terrific book Neurotribes is a kind of manifesto for the neurodiversity 
movement, encouraging us to recognise autism as an example of diversity in the set of all 
possible brains, none of which is ‘normal’ and all of which are simply different."

"In many ways, the concept of neurodiversity is just the next step in this more respectful way of 
thinking about our planet and our communities."

"To expand on the quote attributed to a person with autism, ‘we are fresh water fish in salt 
water. Put us in fresh water and we are fine. Put us in salt water and we struggle to survive’."

"The case for not applying the term ‘disorder’ to autism is that, in an autism-friendly 
environment, the person can function not just well, but sometimes even at a higher level than a 
typical individual."

"Genetic or other kinds of biological variation are intrinsic to the person’s identity, their sense of 
self and personhood, which seen through a human rights lens, should be given equal respect 
alongside any other form of diversity, such as gender."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Growth of DSM Categories: The number of listed disorders in the DSM increased from 

106 in DSM-I (1952) to 300 in DSM-5 (2013).

● Genetics of Autism:

○ Approximately 12% of people with autism have rare inherited or

 de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variants (CNVs) 
associated with autism.

○ Almost 50% of the genetic associations with autism involve inherited common 
variants like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These common variants 
reflect natural variation in the population, not dysfunction.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

The Neurodiversity Framework The central framework advocated for in the paper, presented 
as a revolutionary concept for psychiatry.

● Origin: The term is attributed to Judy Singer, an Australian social scientist with autism, 

and was first printed in 1998.

● Core Concept: Neurodiversity posits that there are many ways for a brain to be 

"normal." It frames autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions as examples of the 
natural diversity of human brains, which are simply wired differently, not defectively.

● Analogy to Biodiversity: The concept is presented as analogous to biodiversity, 

encouraging a respectful attitude towards the rich variation of human minds, just as we 
respect the diversity of life forms in our environment.

● Human Rights: The framework is highly compatible with a civil rights perspective, 

calling for the acceptance and respect of minorities without pathologizing them. It views 
biological variation as intrinsic to a person's identity and personhood.

● Implications: The framework challenges the default assumption that autism is a 

disorder to be eradicated, prevented, or cured. Instead, it calls for a balanced view that 
gives equal attention to a person's strengths and challenges, and promotes support and 
"reasonable adjustments" over "treatment."

Proposed Definitions for Key Terms The paper proposes a rubric for when to use different, 
often conflated, terms:

● "Disorder": "‘Disorder’ should be used when there is nothing positive about the 

condition, or when despite trying different environmental modifications, the person is still 
unable to function." The paper argues this is incompatible with the concept of 
neurodiversity.

● "Disease": "‘Disease’ should be used when the biomedical mechanistic cause of a 
disorder becomes known, perhaps through medical testing or through scientific 
research."

● "Disability": "‘Disability’ should be used when the person falls below an average level of
functioning in one or more psychological or physical functions, and where the individual 
needs support or intervention." This concept is presented as compatible with 
neurodiversity.

● "Difference": "‘Difference’ should be used when the person is simply atypical, for 

biological reasons, relative to a population norm, but where this difference does not 
necessarily affect functioning or well-being."

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Shifting Clinical and Societal Perspectives The neurodiversity framework has several key 
messages that translate into practical applications for clinicians, researchers, and society.

1. Embrace Diversity: Recognize that there is no single "normal" way for a brain to be 

wired.

2. Use Ethical Language: Adopt non-stigmatizing language and concepts for people who 
are different or have disabilities. The paper strongly argues for moving away from the 
term "disorder" and towards "disability" or "difference" when appropriate.
3. Adopt a Balanced, Strengths-Based View: Move away from a model that 

"pathologise[s] and focus[es] disproportionately on what the person struggles with." 
Instead, give equal attention to the person's strengths and talents, such as attention to 
detail and pattern-recognition in autism.

4. Focus on Support, Not Cure: The framework shifts the goal from "cure or treatment" to

"societal support, acceptance of difference and diversity, and societal ‘reasonable 
adjustment’." This implies focusing on creating "autism-friendly environment[s]" where 
autistic individuals can function well and even excel.

5. Respect Identity and Choice: Recognize that an individual's neurotype is an intrinsic 

part of their identity that should be respected. While individuals should have the freedom
to choose interventions that help them, this is different from a default assumption that 
their neurotype needs to be eradicated.
