The Relationship Between Interoception, Emotion, and the Theory of
Constructed Emotion

1. Introduction

The relationship between interoception (the perception of internal bodily states), emotion, and the theory of

constructed emotion represents a paradigm shift in affective neuroscience. The theory of constructed emotion,

most notably advanced by Lisa Feldman Barrett, posits that emotions are not innate, discrete entities but are

dynamically constructed by the brain through the integration of interoceptive signals, conceptual knowledge, and

contextual information. Interoception provides the physiological foundation for core affect, which, when combined

with conceptualization and meaning-making, results in the experience of specific emotions. This framework is

supported by converging evidence from neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical studies, and it challenges traditional

views that emotions are hardwired or universally expressed (Barrett, 2017; Ventura-Bort et al., 2021; Critchley &

Garfinkel, 2017; Wiens, 2005; Seth & Friston, 2016; Zaki et al., 2012; Barrett, 2016; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Quadt

et al., 2018; Garfinkel et al., 2015; Seth, 2013; Craig, 2002; Critchley et al., 2004).

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic
Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search strategy included 20 targeted queries across 8 thematic groups,

focusing on interoception, emotion, constructed emotion theory, predictive coding, and related neural

mechanisms. In total, 1,026 papers were identified, 479 were screened, 356 were deemed eligible, and the 50 most

relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. The Theory of Constructed Emotion: Core Principles

•

•

The theory of constructed emotion proposes that emotions are not biologically fixed but are constructed from

more basic psychological operations: core affect (arising from interoceptive signals), conceptualization

(drawing on past experience and semantic knowledge), and executive attention (Barrett, 2017; Barrett, 2016;

Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Seth, 2013).

Interoception is central to this model, providing the raw physiological data (e.g., heart rate, arousal) that the

brain interprets and categorizes as emotion through predictive coding and active inference (Barrett, 2017; Seth

& Friston, 2016; Barrett, 2016; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Seth, 2013).

3.2. Interoception as the Physiological Basis of Emotion

•

•

Interoceptive signals are processed in brain regions such as the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex,

which are also implicated in emotional awareness and subjective feeling states (Critchley & Garfinkel, 2017; Zaki

et al., 2012; Adolfi et al., 2017; Quadt et al., 2018; Garfinkel et al., 2015; Terasawa et al., 2011; Critchley et al.,

2004).

Individual differences in interoceptive accuracy and sensibility are linked to the intensity, granularity, and
regulation of emotional experiences (Ventura-Bort et al., 2021; Zamariola et al., 2019; Kever et al., 2015; Lischke
et al., 2020; Schuette et al., 2020; Pollatos et al., 2007; Garfinkel et al., 2016; Pinna & Edwards, 2020; Calỉ et al.,
2015).

3.3. Predictive Coding and Active Inference

•

•

The brain uses predictive coding to anticipate interoceptive states and minimize prediction errors, integrating

bodily signals with prior knowledge to construct emotional experiences (Seth & Friston, 2016; Barrett &

Simmons, 2015; Quadt et al., 2018; Seth, 2013; Seth & Critchley, 2013; Owens et al., 2018).

Disruptions in interoceptive inference and prediction are associated with emotional dysregulation and

psychiatric symptoms (Seth & Friston, 2016; Khalsa & Lapidus, 2016; Bonaz et al., 2021; Garfinkel et al., 2016;

Schoeller et al., 2023; Owens et al., 2018).

3.4. Empirical and Clinical Evidence

•

•

•

Neuroimaging studies show overlapping activation in the insula during both interoceptive and emotional tasks,
supporting a shared neural basis (Zaki et al., 2012; Adolfi et al., 2017; Terasawa et al., 2011; Critchley et al., 2004).

Clinical and developmental research links interoceptive dysfunction to emotional disorders, such as anxiety,

depression, and autism spectrum conditions (Khalsa & Lapidus, 2016; Bonaz et al., 2021; Garfinkel et al., 2016;
Schoeller et al., 2023).

Interoceptive training and awareness interventions can enhance emotion regulation and well-being (Schuette et

al., 2020; Füstös et al., 2013; Pinna & Edwards, 2020).

4. Discussion

The evidence strongly supports the view that interoception is foundational to the construction of emotion. The

theory of constructed emotion integrates interoceptive signals with conceptual and contextual information, using

predictive coding to generate emotional experiences (Barrett, 2017; Seth & Friston, 2016; Barrett, 2016; Barrett &

Simmons, 2015; Seth, 2013). This model is supported by neuroimaging findings of shared neural substrates,
behavioral studies linking interoceptive ability to emotional granularity and regulation, and clinical research

showing that interoceptive dysfunction underlies various emotional disorders (Ventura-Bort et al., 2021; Critchley &

Garfinkel, 2017; Zaki et al., 2012; Zamariola et al., 2019; Quadt et al., 2018; Schuette et al., 2020; Khalsa & Lapidus,

2016; Bonaz et al., 2021; Garfinkel et al., 2016; Schoeller et al., 2023; Terasawa et al., 2011; Owens et al., 2018;

Critchley et al., 2004).

The predictive coding framework provides a mechanistic account of how the brain anticipates and interprets bodily

states, with emotion emerging as the brain's best guess about the causes of interoceptive signals (Seth & Friston,

2016; Barrett & Simmons, 2015; Seth, 2013; Seth & Critchley, 2013; Owens et al., 2018). This approach unifies

cognitive, affective, and physiological perspectives, offering a flexible model that accounts for individual and
cultural differences in emotional experience (Barrett, 2017; Ventura-Bort et al., 2021; Prentice et al., 2022; Sullivan &

Minar, 2020; MacCormack et al., 2019).

However, some critiques highlight the need for more direct empirical tests of the theory, especially regarding the
causal role of interoception in emotion construction and the specificity of neural mechanisms (Wiens, 2005;

Sullivan & Minar, 2020; MacCormack et al., 2019). There is also ongoing debate about the balance between innate

and constructed aspects of emotion, particularly in early development (Sullivan & Minar, 2020).

5. Conclusion

The relationship between interoception, emotion, and the theory of constructed emotion is robustly supported by

converging evidence from neuroscience, psychology, and clinical research. Interoception is not only foundational

to emotional experience but is also central to the brain's construction of emotion through predictive, conceptual,

and contextual processes.
