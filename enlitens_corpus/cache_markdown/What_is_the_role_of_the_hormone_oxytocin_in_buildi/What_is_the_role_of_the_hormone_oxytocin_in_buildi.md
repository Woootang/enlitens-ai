Yes, oxytocin plays a key modulatory role in building trust and empathy through
storytelling, but its effects are context-dependent and influenced by individual and
social factors.

1. Introduction

Oxytocin, often called the "social bonding hormone," is deeply involved in human social behaviors, including trust,

empathy, and group cohesion. Recent research shows that storytelling—an immersive, emotionally engaging social

activity—can trigger oxytocin release, which in turn enhances empathic responses and trust among listeners

(Brockington et al., 2021; Barraza & Zak, 2009; Kosfeld et al., 2005; Baumgartner et al., 2008). However, the

relationship is complex: oxytocin’s effects are shaped by genetic, contextual, and individual differences, and while

it generally promotes prosocial behaviors, it can also reinforce in-group biases or have null effects in certain

populations (Barchi-Ferreira & Osorio, 2021; Dreu & Kret, 2016; Nave et al., 2015; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016;

Gong et al., 2017; Ebert & Brüne, 2018; Barraza & Zak, 2009; Schiller et al., 2023; Procyshyn et al., 2020; Di

Giacomo et al., 2024; Walter, 2012; Baumgartner et al., 2008). This review synthesizes evidence on how oxytocin

mediates the social power of storytelling, focusing on its role in empathy and trust.

2. Methods

A Deep Search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic Scholar,

PubMed, and other databases. The search targeted oxytocin, trust, empathy, and storytelling, using 20 unique

strategies spanning neurobiology, genetics, clinical, and social contexts. Out of 1,040 identified papers, 580 were
screened, 318 met eligibility criteria, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1 Storytelling and Oxytocin Release

•

•

•

Direct evidence: Storytelling sessions can increase salivary oxytocin levels, as shown in hospitalized children,

where a single storytelling session led to higher oxytocin, reduced cortisol, and increased positive emotions

compared to a control group (Brockington et al., 2021). This physiological response was linked to greater well-

being and positive social language.

Empathy induction: Watching emotionally charged stories or videos triggers oxytocin release, which correlates

with increased empathy and generosity toward others—even strangers (Barraza & Zak, 2009; Procyshyn et al.,

2020).

Experimental empathy induction: Empathy-inducing narratives reliably increase oxytocin and decrease

testosterone, supporting a biological basis for narrative-driven social connection (Procyshyn et al., 2020).

3.2 Oxytocin, Empathy, and Social Cognition

•

•

•

Empathy enhancement: Oxytocin administration (intranasal or endogenous) generally increases affective

empathy and approach motivation, both in healthy individuals and in clinical populations with social deficits

(Barchi-Ferreira & Osorio, 2021; Gong et al., 2017; Domes et al., 2019; Ebert & Brüne, 2018; Barraza & Zak, 2009;
Procyshyn et al., 2020; Walter, 2012).

Genetic factors: Variations in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), especially rs53576, are associated with

individual differences in empathy and social cognition, influencing how people respond to stories and social
cues (Barchi-Ferreira & Osorio, 2021; Gong et al., 2017).

Neural mechanisms: Oxytocin modulates activity in brain regions involved in emotion and social cognition (e.g.,
amygdala, insula, superior temporal gyrus), supporting the processing of social and narrative information (Grace

et al., 2018; Wigton et al., 2015; Walter, 2012; Baumgartner et al., 2008).

3.3 Oxytocin and Trust

•

•

•

Trust-building: Intranasal oxytocin administration increases trust in economic and social exchange games,

specifically enhancing willingness to accept social risks (Kosfeld et al., 2005; Baumgartner et al., 2008).

Neural basis: Oxytocin reduces amygdala activation (fear processing) and modulates striatal circuits during

trust-related decisions, making individuals less reactive to breaches of trust and more likely to maintain social

engagement (Baumgartner et al., 2008).

Contextual effects: Oxytocin’s trust-enhancing effects are stronger within in-groups and can be modulated by

context, sex, and individual differences (Dreu & Kret, 2016; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016; Schiller et al.,

2023).

3.4 Limitations and Contextual Factors

•

•

•

Mixed findings: Not all studies find robust links between oxytocin and trust; some large-scale studies and

meta-analyses report inconsistent or null effects, especially when considering genetic polymorphisms or
baseline oxytocin levels (Barchi-Ferreira & Osorio, 2021; Nave et al., 2015; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016).

Context-dependence: The effects of oxytocin are shaped by social context, individual traits, and even the

content of the narrative, sometimes leading to increased in-group favoritism or defensive behaviors (Dreu &
Kret, 2016; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016; Di Giacomo et al., 2024).

Clinical populations: In disorders like borderline personality disorder or PTSD, oxytocin’s effects on empathy

and trust are variable and may depend on symptom severity, early life experiences, and genetic background
(Domes et al., 2019; Palgi et al., 2017; Di Giacomo et al., 2024).

4. Discussion

The evidence supports a biopsychosocial model in which storytelling can trigger oxytocin release, thereby

enhancing empathy and trust among listeners (Brockington et al., 2021; Barraza & Zak, 2009; Kosfeld et al., 2005;

Procyshyn et al., 2020; Baumgartner et al., 2008). This effect is mediated by both biological (hormonal, genetic,

neural) and contextual (social, narrative, individual) factors. Oxytocin’s role is not simply to make people more

trusting or empathic; rather, it modulates the salience of social cues, making individuals more attuned to

emotionally relevant information in stories and more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors (Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-
Akel, 2016; Ebert & Brüne, 2018; Grace et al., 2018; Wigton et al., 2015; Walter, 2012). However, the effects are not

universal: oxytocin can also reinforce in-group biases, and its impact varies by context, sex, and individual

differences (Dreu & Kret, 2016; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016; Schiller et al., 2023; Di Giacomo et al., 2024).

Some studies report null or inconsistent effects, highlighting the need for more rigorous, context-sensitive research

(Barchi-Ferreira & Osorio, 2021; Nave et al., 2015; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016).

5. Conclusion

Oxytocin is a key biological mediator of the social power of storytelling, enhancing empathy and trust through both

direct hormonal effects and modulation of social cognition. However, its effects are nuanced, context-dependent,

and shaped by individual and group factors.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for oxytocin’s role in narrative-driven empathy and trust, more research is needed on its

long-term effects, the influence of narrative content, and its application in diverse populations and real-world

settings.
