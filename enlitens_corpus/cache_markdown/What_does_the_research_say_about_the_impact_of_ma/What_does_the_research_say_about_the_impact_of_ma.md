Yes, masking or camouflaging is strongly associated with increased mental health
difficulties—including anxiety, depression, stress, burnout, and suicidality—among
autistic individuals, with negative effects observed across age, gender, and cultural
contexts.

1. Introduction

Masking or camouflaging refers to the strategies autistic individuals use to hide or suppress autistic traits and

appear more neurotypical in social situations. A robust and growing body of research demonstrates that

camouflaging is common among autistic people and is consistently linked to poorer mental health outcomes,

including heightened anxiety, depression, stress, burnout, and suicidality (Field et al., 2024; Hull et al., 2021; Ross et

al., 2022; Bradley et al., 2021; Beck et al., 2020; Bernardin et al., 2021; Zhuang et al., 2023; Cage & Troxell-Whitman,

2019; Lei et al., 2024; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Keating et al., 2024; Evans et al., 2023;

Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Cremone et al., 2023; Milner et al., 2022; Cook et al., 2021; Perry et al.,

2020; Lai et al., 2016; Cassidy et al., 2019; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Sedgewick et al., 2022;

Buchholz, 2023). While some individuals report short-term social or practical benefits from camouflaging, the long-

term psychological costs are substantial, with negative impacts on self-esteem, authenticity, and identity. These

effects are observed in both adults and youth, across genders, and in diverse cultural settings. The literature also
highlights the role of societal stigma and lack of acceptance as key drivers of camouflaging, suggesting that

reducing the need to mask could improve mental health outcomes for autistic people (Field et al., 2024; Bradley et

al., 2021; Zhuang et al., 2023; Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Keating et al., 2024; Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al.,

2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Radulski, 2022; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025;

Sedgewick et al., 2022; Buchholz, 2023).

2. Methods

A comprehensive Deep Search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search strategy targeted foundational theories, empirical

studies, measurement tools, subgroups, cross-cultural perspectives, and critiques on masking/camouflaging and

mental health in autism. In total, 1024 papers were identified, 482 were screened, 310 were deemed eligible, and
the top 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1 Prevalence and Motivations for Masking

Masking is widely reported among autistic individuals, especially in social or high-stakes environments, and is often
motivated by a desire to avoid stigma, fit in, or gain social acceptance (Field et al., 2024; Bradley et al., 2021;

Zhuang et al., 2023; Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Alaghband-Rad et al., 2023; Rivera & Bennetto, 2023; Keating

et al., 2024; Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Radulski, 2022;
McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Sedgewick et al., 2022; Buchholz, 2023). Females and gender-diverse

individuals may camouflage more frequently, partly due to social expectations and gender norms (Cage & Troxell-

Whitman, 2019; Milner et al., 2022; Lai et al., 2016; Drapalik et al., 2025).

3.2 Mental Health Consequences

A large number of studies, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, show that higher levels of

camouflaging are associated with increased symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, burnout, and suicidality (Field
et al., 2024; Hull et al., 2021; Ross et al., 2022; Bradley et al., 2021; Beck et al., 2020; Bernardin et al., 2021; Zhuang

et al., 2023; Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Lei et al., 2024; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024;

Keating et al., 2024; Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Cremone et al., 2023; Milner et
al., 2022; Cook et al., 2021; Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016; Cassidy et al., 2019; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et

al., 2025; Sedgewick et al., 2022; Buchholz, 2023). The relationship is observed in both adults and youth, and

across cultures (Ross et al., 2022; Beck et al., 2020; Bernardin et al., 2021; Zhuang et al., 2023; Cage & Troxell-

Whitman, 2019; Lei et al., 2024; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Keating et al., 2024; Evans et
al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Cremone et al., 2023; Milner et al., 2022; Cook et al., 2021;

Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016; Cassidy et al., 2019; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Sedgewick et al.,

2022; Buchholz, 2023). Some studies suggest that the negative impact is particularly strong for those who
camouflage across multiple contexts or do so habitually (Field et al., 2024; Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Van Der

Putten et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016; McQuaid et al.,

2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Buchholz, 2023).

3.3 Mechanisms and Moderators

The negative effects of masking are mediated by increased stress, emotional exhaustion, loss of authenticity, and
identity confusion (Field et al., 2024; Bradley et al., 2021; Zhuang et al., 2023; Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Lei et

al., 2024; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et

al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Radulski, 2022; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Sedgewick et al., 2022;
Buchholz, 2023). Stigma, lack of acceptance, and minority stress are key external drivers (Zhuang et al., 2023;

Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Keating et al., 2024; Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024;

Perry et al., 2020; Radulski, 2022; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Sedgewick et al., 2022; Buchholz,

2023). Some individuals report short-term benefits (e.g., social acceptance, employment), but these are often
outweighed by long-term psychological costs (Field et al., 2024; Bradley et al., 2021; Cage & Troxell-Whitman,

2019; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016;

McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Buchholz, 2023). There is some evidence that community
connectedness and self-acceptance may buffer negative effects, but these factors do not fully mitigate the risks

(Cage et al., 2021; Attaullah, 2023; Cage et al., 2017).

3.4 Subgroup and Contextual Differences

While the association between masking and poor mental health is robust, the strength of this relationship varies by

individual factors such as gender, age, level of autistic traits, and context (Ross et al., 2022; Beck et al., 2020;
Bernardin et al., 2021; Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Keating

et al., 2024; Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Cremone et al., 2023; Milner et al.,

2022; Cook et al., 2021; Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016; Cassidy et al., 2019; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al.,
2025; Sedgewick et al., 2022; Buchholz, 2023). Some studies note that a small subgroup may not experience

negative effects, but for most, camouflaging is a risk factor for mental health difficulties (Van Der Putten et al.,

2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik

et al., 2025; Buchholz, 2023).

4. Discussion

The evidence overwhelmingly supports that masking or camouflaging is a significant risk factor for mental health

difficulties in autistic individuals. The association is robust across methodologies, age groups, and cultural contexts,

with moderate to strong correlations found in meta-analyses and large-scale studies (Field et al., 2024; Hull et al.,

2021; Ross et al., 2022; Bradley et al., 2021; Beck et al., 2020; Bernardin et al., 2021; Zhuang et al., 2023; Cage &

Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Lei et al., 2024; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Keating et al., 2024;

Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Cremone et al., 2023; Milner et al., 2022; Cook et
al., 2021; Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016; Cassidy et al., 2019; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025;

Sedgewick et al., 2022; Buchholz, 2023). The mechanisms involve increased stress, emotional exhaustion, and loss

of authenticity, often driven by societal stigma and lack of acceptance (Field et al., 2024; Bradley et al., 2021;

Zhuang et al., 2023; Cage & Troxell-Whitman, 2019; Lei et al., 2024; Van Der Putten et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al.,

2024; Evans et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Radulski, 2022; McQuaid et

al., 2023; Drapalik et al., 2025; Sedgewick et al., 2022; Buchholz, 2023). While some individuals report short-term

benefits, the long-term psychological costs are substantial. There is a need for interventions that reduce the
pressure to camouflage and promote acceptance of neurodiversity.

However, the relationship is not uniform for all autistic people. Some subgroups may experience less negative

impact, and a minority may report neutral or even positive effects in specific contexts (Van Der Putten et al., 2023;

Moore et al., 2023; Khudiakova et al., 2024; Perry et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2016; McQuaid et al., 2023; Drapalik et al.,

2025; Buchholz, 2023). More research is needed to clarify these differences and to develop individualized
supports.

5. Conclusion

Masking or camouflaging is a widespread phenomenon among autistic individuals and is strongly associated with

increased risk of mental health difficulties, including anxiety, depression, stress, burnout, and suicidality. The
negative effects are driven by societal stigma and lack of acceptance, and while some may experience short-term
benefits, the long-term psychological costs are substantial.

5.1 Research Gaps

Key gaps include the need for more longitudinal and causal studies, research on underrepresented groups (e.g.,

non-binary, non-Western, intellectually disabled), and interventions to reduce stigma and support authentic self-
expression.
