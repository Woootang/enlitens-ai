Yes, the Default Mode Network (DMN) is central to self-referential thought and
plays a crucial role in constructing and maintaining personal identity by
integrating autobiographical memory, self-reflection, and internal narrative
processes.

1. Introduction

The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a large-scale brain network that is most active during rest and internally

focused states, such as daydreaming, mind-wandering, and self-reflection. Extensive research demonstrates that

the DMN—comprising regions like the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),

precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule—supports self-referential thought, autobiographical memory, and the

construction of a coherent sense of identity (Davey et al., 2016; Menon, 2023; Wen et al., 2019; Van Buuren et al.,

2010; Lanius et al., 2020; Delahoy et al., 2022; Yan, 2024; Knyazev et al., 2020; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Spreng &

Grady, 2010; Katsumi et al., 2024; Qin & Northoff, 2011; Yankouskaya & Sui, 2021; Vessel et al., 2013; Wirth et al.,

2011; Doucet et al., 2020; Azarias et al., 2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019). The DMN

integrates information about the self across time, enabling individuals to reflect on their past, imagine their future,

and maintain a stable self-concept. Disruptions in DMN connectivity are linked to disturbances in self-related

processing in various psychiatric and neurological conditions, highlighting its foundational role in identity and self-
awareness (Lanius et al., 2020; Sheline et al., 2009; Doucet et al., 2020; Chou et al., 2023; Jamieson et al., 2023).

This review synthesizes current research on the DMN’s role in self-referential thought and identity.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search strategy targeted foundational theories, neuroimaging studies,
clinical research, and meta-analyses on the DMN’s role in self-referential thought and identity. In total, 1031 papers

were identified, 546 were screened, 356 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included

in this review.

3. Results

3.1 Core DMN Regions and Self-Referential Processing

The DMN’s core regions—mPFC, PCC, and inferior parietal lobule—are consistently activated during self-
referential tasks, such as reflecting on personal traits, preferences, and autobiographical memories (Davey et al.,

2016; Wen et al., 2019; Van Buuren et al., 2010; Delahoy et al., 2022; Yan, 2024; Knyazev et al., 2020; Qin &

Northoff, 2011; Yankouskaya & Sui, 2021; Vessel et al., 2013; Wirth et al., 2011; Doucet et al., 2020; Azarias et al.,
2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019). These regions show increased activity when individuals

think about themselves compared to thinking about others or performing externally focused tasks (Davey et al.,

2016; Wen et al., 2019; Van Buuren et al., 2010; Delahoy et al., 2022; Yan, 2024; Knyazev et al., 2020; Qin &
Northoff, 2011; Yankouskaya & Sui, 2021; Vessel et al., 2013; Wirth et al., 2011; Doucet et al., 2020; Azarias et al.,

2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019).

3.2 Functional Specialization and Subsystems

The DMN is not homogeneous; it contains subsystems with specialized roles. The medial prefrontal cortex is

primarily implicated in self-referential processing and affective decision-making, while the PCC and precuneus are
involved in integrating autobiographical memory and spatial aspects of self (Davey et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2019;

Van Buuren et al., 2010; Delahoy et al., 2022; Yan, 2024; Knyazev et al., 2020; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Spreng &

Grady, 2010; Katsumi et al., 2024; Qin & Northoff, 2011; Yankouskaya & Sui, 2021; Vessel et al., 2013; Wirth et al.,

2011; Doucet et al., 2020; Azarias et al., 2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019). The medial
temporal lobe subsystem supports memory-based scene construction and future-oriented thought (Wen et al.,

2019; Spreng & Grady, 2010; Katsumi et al., 2024; Wirth et al., 2011; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019).

3.3 DMN and Identity Construction

The DMN integrates memory, language, and semantic representations to create a coherent internal narrative,

which is central to the construction and maintenance of personal identity (Menon, 2023; Lanius et al., 2020;
Yeshurun et al., 2021; Spreng & Grady, 2010; Katsumi et al., 2024; Vessel et al., 2013; Wirth et al., 2011; Doucet et al.,

2020; Azarias et al., 2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019). This network enables individuals to

link past experiences with present self-concept and future goals, supporting a continuous sense of self across time
(Menon, 2023; Lanius et al., 2020; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Spreng & Grady, 2010; Katsumi et al., 2024; Vessel et al.,

2013; Wirth et al., 2011; Doucet et al., 2020; Azarias et al., 2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019).

3.4 Clinical and Developmental Perspectives

Alterations in DMN connectivity are associated with disruptions in self-related processing in conditions such as

depression, PTSD, schizophrenia, and social anxiety disorder (Lanius et al., 2020; Sheline et al., 2009; Doucet et al.,

2020; Chou et al., 2023; Jamieson et al., 2023). Developmental studies show that DMN maturation parallels the
emergence of self-concept and identity during childhood and adolescence (Azarias et al., 2025; Alarcón et al.,

2018).

4. Discussion

The DMN is central to self-referential thought and identity, acting as a neural hub for integrating autobiographical

memory, self-reflection, and internal narrative (Davey et al., 2016; Menon, 2023; Wen et al., 2019; Van Buuren et al.,

2010; Lanius et al., 2020; Delahoy et al., 2022; Yan, 2024; Knyazev et al., 2020; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Spreng &
Grady, 2010; Katsumi et al., 2024; Qin & Northoff, 2011; Yankouskaya & Sui, 2021; Vessel et al., 2013; Wirth et al.,

2011; Doucet et al., 2020; Azarias et al., 2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019). Its core regions

(mPFC, PCC, IPL) are consistently engaged during self-focused cognition, and its subsystems support the

integration of social, emotional, and memory-based information (Davey et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2019; Van Buuren et

al., 2010; Delahoy et al., 2022; Yan, 2024; Knyazev et al., 2020; Yeshurun et al., 2021; Spreng & Grady, 2010;

Katsumi et al., 2024; Qin & Northoff, 2011; Yankouskaya & Sui, 2021; Vessel et al., 2013; Wirth et al., 2011; Doucet et

al., 2020; Azarias et al., 2025; Chou et al., 2023; Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019). The DMN’s role in constructing a
coherent sense of self is further supported by evidence from clinical populations, where disruptions in DMN

connectivity are linked to disturbances in self-concept and identity (Lanius et al., 2020; Sheline et al., 2009; Doucet

et al., 2020; Chou et al., 2023; Jamieson et al., 2023). Developmental and cross-cultural studies highlight the

DMN’s flexibility and its interaction with other brain networks in shaping self-representation (Yeshurun et al., 2021;

Knyazev et al., 2020; Azarias et al., 2025; Alarcón et al., 2018).

However, the DMN is not the only network involved in self-related processing; interactions with the salience

network, frontoparietal control network, and limbic system also contribute to the richness and adaptability of self-

concept (Wen et al., 2019; Yankouskaya & Sui, 2021; Wirth et al., 2011; Azarias et al., 2025; Chou et al., 2023;

Fuentes-Claramonte et al., 2019). Ongoing research is clarifying the specific contributions of DMN subsystems and
their dynamic interactions with other networks.

5. Conclusion

The Default Mode Network is a central neural system for self-referential thought and identity, integrating memory,
emotion, and social information to construct a coherent sense of self. Its core regions and subsystems support the

dynamic interplay between internal narrative, autobiographical memory, and self-reflection, with disruptions in

DMN function linked to disturbances in self-concept across clinical populations.
