The Effects of White Space and Line Length on Reading Speed and Engagement

1. Introduction

White space (including line, paragraph, and margin spacing) and line length are fundamental elements of text

layout that influence how efficiently and comfortably people read digital content. Research shows that moderate

increases in white space—especially line and paragraph spacing—can improve reading speed, comfort, and

subjective engagement, but excessive spacing may hinder performance by increasing scrolling or fragmenting the

text (Huang et al., 2018; Chaparro et al., 2004; Kwok et al., 2023; Chiu & Drieghe, 2023; Chan & Lee, 2005; Zhou et

al., 2023; Scaltritti et al., 2019; Ling & Schaik, 2007). Similarly, optimal line lengths (typically 50–75 characters per

line) facilitate faster reading and better comprehension, while lines that are too short or too long can slow readers

down and reduce engagement (Dyson, 2004; Schneps et al., 2013; Duchnicky & Kolers, 1983; Scaltritti et al., 2019).

The effects of these variables can differ across populations, with individuals with dyslexia or visual impairments

often benefiting more from increased spacing and shorter lines (Joo et al., 2018; Schneps et al., 2013; Blackmore-

Wright et al., 2013; Perea et al., 2012; Galliussi et al., 2020; Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2015; Zorzi et al., 2012; Sjoblom et

al., 2016). However, the relationship is nuanced, and the best configuration depends on the reading context, device,

and user needs.

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic

Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search targeted studies on white space, line length, reading speed, and

engagement, with a focus on digital and screen-based reading. Out of 1,032 identified papers, 737 were screened,

468 met eligibility criteria, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1 White Space: Line, Paragraph, and Margin Spacing

•

Line and paragraph spacing: Moderate increases in line and paragraph spacing generally improve reading

speed, comfort, and subjective ratings of ease and preference (Huang et al., 2018; Chaparro et al., 2004; Kwok

et al., 2023; Chiu & Drieghe, 2023; Chan & Lee, 2005; Zhou et al., 2023; Scaltritti et al., 2019; Ling & Schaik,

2007). For example, chunking text into discriminable paragraphs with extra white space reduces reading time

and increases comfort (Huang et al., 2018). However, excessive white space can increase scrolling and reduce

reading efficiency, especially on small screens (Huang et al., 2018; Hou et al., 2018).

•

•

Margins: Adding margins slows reading speed slightly but improves comprehension and user satisfaction, likely

by reducing visual clutter and supporting better focus (Chaparro et al., 2004).

Inter-word and inter-letter spacing: Increased spacing can help readers with dyslexia and visual crowding,

improving speed and accuracy (Joo et al., 2018; Schneps et al., 2013; Blackmore-Wright et al., 2013; Perea et al.,

2012; Galliussi et al., 2020; Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2015; Zorzi et al., 2012; Sjoblom et al., 2016). For typical readers,

small increases in spacing may have minimal or mixed effects (Perea et al., 2016).

3.2 Line Length

•

•

Optimal line length: Lines of 50–75 characters (or about 10–12 words) are generally optimal for reading speed
and comprehension (Dyson, 2004; Schneps et al., 2013; Duchnicky & Kolers, 1983; Scaltritti et al., 2019). Shorter

lines can benefit readers with dyslexia or attention difficulties, but lines that are too short or too long can disrupt
reading flow and slow down reading (Schneps et al., 2013; Duchnicky & Kolers, 1983; Scaltritti et al., 2019).

Device and context: On smartphones and tablets, shorter lines and increased spacing are often preferred, but
excessive fragmentation can require more scrolling and reduce efficiency (Huang et al., 2018; Kwok et al., 2023;

Hou et al., 2018).

3.3 Engagement and User Experience

•

•

Readability and engagement: Higher readability, achieved through optimal spacing and line length, increases

user engagement, satisfaction, and even social media interactions (Pancer et al., 2018; Scaltritti et al., 2019; Ling
& Schaik, 2007).

Subjective preferences: Users generally prefer layouts with moderate white space and optimal line lengths,

reporting greater comfort and aesthetic appeal (Huang et al., 2018; Chaparro et al., 2004; Hou et al., 2018;
Scaltritti et al., 2019; Ling & Schaik, 2007).

3.4 Special Populations

•

•

Dyslexia and visual impairments: Increased spacing and shorter lines can significantly improve reading speed,

accuracy, and comprehension for readers with dyslexia or low vision (Joo et al., 2018; Schneps et al., 2013;

Blackmore-Wright et al., 2013; Perea et al., 2012; Galliussi et al., 2020; Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2015; Zorzi et al.,
2012; Sjoblom et al., 2016).

Children and older adults: Larger text and increased spacing benefit young children and older adults,

improving speed and reducing errors (Chan & Lee, 2005; Hou et al., 2018; Hughes & Wilkins, 2000).

4. Discussion

The evidence indicates that moderate increases in white space and optimal line lengths enhance both reading

speed and engagement for most readers, especially in digital contexts (Huang et al., 2018; Chaparro et al., 2004;

Schneps et al., 2013; Scaltritti et al., 2019; Ling & Schaik, 2007). These effects are particularly pronounced for

individuals with dyslexia or visual impairments, who benefit from increased spacing and shorter lines (Joo et al.,

2018; Schneps et al., 2013; Blackmore-Wright et al., 2013; Perea et al., 2012; Galliussi et al., 2020; Rello & Baeza-

Yates, 2015; Zorzi et al., 2012; Sjoblom et al., 2016). However, there are diminishing returns: excessive white space
can fragment text, increase scrolling, and reduce efficiency, especially on small screens (Huang et al., 2018; Hou et

al., 2018). Similarly, lines that are too short or too long can disrupt reading flow (Dyson, 2004; Schneps et al., 2013;

Duchnicky & Kolers, 1983; Scaltritti et al., 2019).

User preferences generally align with objective performance, favoring layouts that balance readability and

aesthetic appeal (Huang et al., 2018; Chaparro et al., 2004; Hou et al., 2018; Scaltritti et al., 2019; Ling & Schaik,

2007). For web and mobile design, these findings support established guidelines recommending moderate line and

paragraph spacing, clear margins, and line lengths of 50–75 characters.

5. Conclusion

Moderate use of white space and optimal line length significantly improve reading speed, comprehension, and

engagement for most readers, with especially strong benefits for those with dyslexia or visual impairments.

Excessive spacing or poorly chosen line lengths can reduce efficiency, highlighting the need for balanced, user-

centered design.
