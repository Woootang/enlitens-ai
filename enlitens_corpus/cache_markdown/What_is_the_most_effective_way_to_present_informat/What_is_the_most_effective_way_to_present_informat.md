The most effective way to present information that contradicts a person's existing
worldview is to align the message with the audience’s values, use credible
sources, and employ affirming, non-confrontational strategies—rather than
simply providing more facts or direct refutation.

1. Introduction

Presenting information that challenges a person’s deeply held worldview is notoriously difficult, as people often

resist, ignore, or even strengthen their original beliefs in response to contradictory evidence—a phenomenon

explained by cognitive dissonance, motivated reasoning, and confirmation bias (Yahya & Sukmayadi, 2020; Zhou &

Shen, 2021; Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2020; Kappes et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 2016; Lewandowsky & Oberauer,

2021; Newman et al., 2018; Hornsey, 2021). However, recent research shows that belief change is possible,

especially when the information is perceived as strong, comes from a trusted source, and is delivered in a way that

affirms the individual’s identity or values (Sanna & Lagnado, 2025; Anglin et al., 2025; Wood & Porter, 2019; Sauer

et al., 2021; Hornsey & Fielding, 2017; Hornsey, 2021; Costello et al., 2024; Nyhan & Reifler, 2019). Strategies such

as value-congruent framing, consensus messaging, inoculation (prebunking), and personalized, respectful dialogue

have been shown to reduce resistance and promote openness to new information (Cook et al., 2017; Hornsey &

Fielding, 2017; Hornsey, 2021; Costello et al., 2024; Nyhan & Reifler, 2019). Contrary to popular belief, the so-called
“backfire effect”—where contradictory information strengthens prior beliefs—is rare, and most people will update

their beliefs if the evidence is compelling and the approach is thoughtful (Guess & Coppock, 2018; Wood & Porter,

2019; Nyhan, 2021; Sauer et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021). The most effective interventions are those that go beyond

simply presenting facts, instead addressing the psychological, social, and emotional roots of worldview defense.

2. Methods

A comprehensive Deep Search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and other sources. The search targeted communication strategies, psychological

models, and interventions for presenting worldview-disconfirming information. In total, 1,024 papers were

identified, 922 were screened, 664 were deemed eligible, and the top 50 most relevant papers were included in

this review.

3. Results

3.1 Resistance to Contradictory Information

People tend to resist information that contradicts their worldview due to cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias,
and identity protection (Yahya & Sukmayadi, 2020; Zhou & Shen, 2021; Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2020; Kappes

et al., 2019; Kaplan et al., 2016; Lewandowsky & Oberauer, 2021; Newman et al., 2018; Hornsey, 2021). Selective

exposure, motivated reasoning, and emotional discomfort are common responses, especially for highly polarized or
identity-relevant topics (Kaplan et al., 2016; Zhou & Shen, 2021; Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2020; Rollwage et al.,

2020; Trevors et al., 2016).

3.2 The (Rare) Backfire Effect and Belief Change

Contrary to earlier fears, large-scale studies and meta-analyses show that the “backfire effect” is rare; most people

do not strengthen their beliefs when confronted with contradictory evidence (Guess & Coppock, 2018; Wood &
Porter, 2019; Nyhan, 2021; Sauer et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021). Instead, belief change is possible, especially when

evidence is strong, clear, and perceived as credible (Sanna & Lagnado, 2025; Anglin et al., 2025; Wood & Porter,

2019; Sauer et al., 2021; Costello et al., 2024).

3.3 Effective Communication Strategies

•

•

•

•

•

•

Value-congruent framing: Messages that align with the audience’s core values or identity are more persuasive

and less likely to trigger resistance (Hornsey & Fielding, 2017; Hornsey, 2021; Lewandowsky & Oberauer, 2021).

Credible sources: Belief updating is more likely when information comes from a trusted, reliable source (Sanna

& Lagnado, 2025; Kaplan et al., 2016; Lewandowsky & Oberauer, 2021; Kappes et al., 2019).

Affirmation and non-confrontational approaches: Self-affirmation, respectful dialogue, and avoiding direct
attacks on identity reduce defensiveness and increase openness (Hornsey & Fielding, 2017; Boler, 2013; Nyhan

& Reifler, 2019).

Consensus messaging: Highlighting scientific or social consensus can shift perceptions, especially on polarized
issues (Sauer et al., 2021; Hornsey, 2021).

Inoculation (prebunking): Preemptively exposing audiences to weakened forms of misinformation and

refutations builds resistance to future contradictory information (Cook et al., 2017).

Personalized, interactive dialogue: Tailored, respectful conversations (even with AI) can durably reduce

entrenched false beliefs (Costello et al., 2024).

3.4 Less Effective or Counterproductive Approaches

•

•

Fact overload: Simply providing more facts or data, especially in a confrontational manner, is often ineffective
and can increase resistance (Hornsey & Fielding, 2017; Hornsey, 2021; Yahya & Sukmayadi, 2020; Newman et

al., 2018).

Aggressive or identity-threatening messages: Direct attacks on core beliefs or identity are likely to trigger
defensiveness and rejection (Boler, 2013; Yahya & Sukmayadi, 2020; Trevors et al., 2016).

4. Discussion

The literature demonstrates that while people are naturally resistant to information that contradicts their worldview,

belief change is possible—especially when communicators use strategies that respect identity, leverage credible
sources, and frame messages in value-congruent ways (Sanna & Lagnado, 2025; Anglin et al., 2025; Wood &

Porter, 2019; Sauer et al., 2021; Hornsey & Fielding, 2017; Hornsey, 2021; Costello et al., 2024; Nyhan & Reifler,

2019). The “deficit model” (just providing more facts) is largely ineffective for deeply held beliefs (Hornsey &

Fielding, 2017; Hornsey, 2021; Yahya & Sukmayadi, 2020; Newman et al., 2018). Instead, interventions that address

the psychological roots of resistance—such as identity, values, and trust—are more successful (Hornsey & Fielding,

2017; Hornsey, 2021; Lewandowsky & Oberauer, 2021; Nyhan & Reifler, 2019). Inoculation (prebunking) and

consensus messaging are particularly promising, as is personalized, respectful dialogue (Cook et al., 2017; Costello
et al., 2024). The backfire effect is much less common than previously thought, and most people will update their

beliefs if the evidence is strong, credible, and presented thoughtfully (Guess & Coppock, 2018; Wood & Porter,

2019; Nyhan, 2021; Sauer et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021).

5. Conclusion

The most effective way to present information that contradicts a person’s worldview is to use value-congruent
framing, credible sources, and affirming, non-confrontational strategies—rather than simply providing more facts

or direct refutation. Approaches that respect identity, build trust, and engage audiences in dialogue are most likely

to foster openness and belief change.

5.1 Research Gaps

Despite strong evidence for these strategies, gaps remain in understanding their long-term effectiveness,

scalability, and application across diverse cultures and contexts. More research is needed on how to tailor

interventions for different audiences and how to sustain belief change over time.

5.2 Open Research Questions

Future research should explore how to sustain belief change, scale effective interventions, and adapt strategies for

diverse audiences and contexts.

Question

Why

How can value-congruent and identity-affirming strategies
be scaled for mass communication?

Scaling up effective interventions is crucial for
societal impact.

What are the long-term effects of inoculation and consensus
messaging on deeply held beliefs?

Understanding durability is key for lasting
change.

How can interventions be tailored for different cultural,
political, or demographic groups?

Customization may be necessary for
effectiveness across diverse audiences.

FIGURE  Open research questions for future investigation into presenting worldview-disconfirming information.

In summary, the most effective way to present information that contradicts a person’s worldview is to align

messages with their values, use credible sources, and employ affirming, non-confrontational strategies—
approaches that respect identity and build trust are most likely to foster openness and belief change.
