Yes, adult attachment styles are strongly linked to autonomic nervous system regulation, with secure
attachment supporting balanced physiological responses and insecure attachment (anxious or avoidant)
associated with dysregulated stress reactivity and emotion regulation.

1. Introduction

A substantial body of research demonstrates that adult attachment styles—secure, anxious, avoidant, and disorganized—are closely associated
with patterns of autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. Secure attachment is consistently linked to balanced emotion regulation and

adaptive physiological responses to stress, while insecure attachment (anxious or avoidant) is associated with heightened or dysregulated ANS
reactivity, including altered heart rate variability, skin conductance, and cortisol responses (Eilert & Buchheim, 2023; Diamond & Fagundes, 2010;
Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Quirin et al., 2008; Groh et al., 2024; Gander & Buchheim, 2015; Maunder et al., 2006; Pierrehumbert et al., 2012;
Roisman, 2007; Diamond et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Domic-Siede et al., 2024; Norman et al., 2015;

Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015; Smyth et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018). These physiological
patterns reflect underlying differences in emotion regulation strategies and stress coping, with implications for mental and physical health. The

relationship is bidirectional: attachment influences ANS regulation, and physiological responses can reinforce attachment-related behaviors and
perceptions (Eilert & Buchheim, 2023; Diamond & Fagundes, 2010; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Quirin et al., 2008; Groh et al., 2024; Gander &
Buchheim, 2015; Maunder et al., 2006; Pierrehumbert et al., 2012; Roisman, 2007; Diamond et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al.,

Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018).

3. Results

3.1 Secure Attachment and Balanced ANS Regulation

Securely attached adults consistently show balanced emotion regulation and adaptive ANS responses to stress, including lower cortisol
reactivity, greater heart rate variability (HRV), and reduced sympathetic arousal (Eilert & Buchheim, 2023; Diamond & Fagundes, 2010;
Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Quirin et al., 2008; Groh et al., 2024; Gander & Buchheim, 2015; Maunder et al., 2006; Pierrehumbert et al., 2012;

Roisman, 2007; Diamond et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Domic-Siede et al., 2024; Norman et al., 2015;
Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015; Smyth et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018). Secure attachment is
associated with open emotional expression, effective coping, and the ability to use social support to buffer stress (Eilert & Buchheim, 2023;

Diamond & Fagundes, 2010; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Quirin et al., 2008; Groh et al., 2024; Gander & Buchheim, 2015; Maunder et al., 2006;
Pierrehumbert et al., 2012; Roisman, 2007; Diamond et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Domic-Siede et al.,
2024; Norman et al., 2015; Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015; Smyth et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018).

3.2 Insecure Attachment and Dysregulated ANS Responses

Insecure attachment styles (anxious, avoidant, fearful) are linked to dysregulated ANS activity. Anxious attachment is associated with heightened

subjective distress, increased cortisol and sympathetic reactivity, and difficulties in emotion regulation (Diamond & Fagundes, 2010;
Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Quirin et al., 2008; Gander & Buchheim, 2015; Maunder et al., 2006; Pierrehumbert et al., 2012; Roisman, 2007;
Diamond et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Domic-Siede et al., 2024; Norman et al., 2015; Pietromonaco &

Powers, 2015; Smyth et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018). Avoidant attachment is characterized by
physiological hyperarousal (e.g., increased skin conductance, suppressed HRV) despite self-reported emotional suppression or detachment
(Diamond & Fagundes, 2010; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Quirin et al., 2008; Gander & Buchheim, 2015; Maunder et al., 2006; Pierrehumbert et

al., 2012; Roisman, 2007; Diamond et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Domic-Siede et al., 2024; Norman et
al., 2015; Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015; Smyth et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018). Disorganized or
unresolved attachment is linked to counterintuitive or blunted physiological responses (Eilert & Buchheim, 2023; Pierrehumbert et al., 2012).

3.3 Neuroendocrine and Neural Correlates

Attachment insecurity is associated with altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, including abnormal cortisol rhythms and
reactivity (Diamond & Fagundes, 2010; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Costa-Martins et al., 2016; Quirin et al., 2008; Gander & Buchheim, 2015;
Kidd et al., 2011; Pierrehumbert et al., 2012; Roisman, 2007; Diamond et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021;

Domic-Siede et al., 2024; Norman et al., 2015; Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015; Smyth et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant &
Hutanamon, 2018). Neuroimaging and neuroendocrine studies implicate the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and endogenous opioid and oxytocin
systems in mediating the link between attachment and ANS regulation (Lemche et al., 2006; Nummenmaa et al., 2015; Norman et al., 2015; Long
et al., 2020; Carter & Carter, 1998).

3.4 Moderators and Contextual Factors

The relationship between attachment and ANS regulation is influenced by context (e.g., presence of a partner, type of stressor), gender, and
developmental history (Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Girme et al., 2020; Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015;
Durak, 2024; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; McMahon et al., 2020). Dyadic and social support factors can buffer or exacerbate physiological stress
responses depending on both partners' attachment styles (Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Girme et al., 2020;
Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015; Durak, 2024; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; McMahon et al., 2020).

4. Discussion

The evidence robustly supports a strong relationship between adult attachment styles and autonomic nervous system regulation. Secure

attachment is protective, supporting adaptive physiological and emotional responses to stress, while insecure attachment is a risk factor for
dysregulated ANS activity and impaired emotion regulation (Eilert & Buchheim, 2023; Diamond & Fagundes, 2010; Pietromonaco & Beck, 2019;
Quirin et al., 2008; Groh et al., 2024; Gander & Buchheim, 2015; Maunder et al., 2006; Pierrehumbert et al., 2012; Roisman, 2007; Diamond et al.,
2006; Henschel et al., 2020; Powers et al., 2006; Han et al., 2021; Domic-Siede et al., 2024; Norman et al., 2015; Pietromonaco & Powers, 2015;
Smyth et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Cascino et al., 2021; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018). These patterns are observed across diverse populations
and stress contexts, and are mediated by both neuroendocrine and neural mechanisms (Lemche et al., 2006; Nummenmaa et al., 2015; Norman
et al., 2015; Long et al., 2020; Carter & Carter, 1998). The findings have important implications for understanding the psychobiological basis of

mental and physical health, and for developing interventions that target attachment and emotion regulation.

However, some inconsistencies exist, particularly regarding the specific physiological profiles of different insecure attachment styles and the
influence of contextual moderators (Ataherian et al., 2024; Kidd et al., 2011; Durak, 2024; Smyth et al., 2015; McMahon et al., 2020). More
research is needed to clarify these nuances and to explore the stability of attachment-ANS links across the lifespan.

5.2 Open Research Questions

Future research should clarify the mechanisms linking attachment and ANS regulation, explore interventions to enhance attachment security, and
examine cultural and developmental moderators.

Question

Why

How do neural and neuroendocrine pathways mediate the relationship
between adult attachment and ANS regulation?

Understanding mechanisms will inform targeted interventions
for emotion regulation and health.

Can interventions that enhance attachment security improve ANS regulation
and health outcomes in adults?

This could guide clinical and preventive strategies for stress-
related disorders.

How do cultural, developmental, and dyadic factors moderate the
attachment-ANS relationship?

Addressing these moderators will improve the generalizability
and applicability of findings.

FIGURE  Key open questions for advancing research on adult attachment and autonomic nervous system regulation.

In summary, adult attachment styles are robustly linked to autonomic nervous system regulation, shaping emotion regulation, stress responses,
and health across the lifespan.
