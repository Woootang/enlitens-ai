DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This influential paper by Virginia Braun and Victoria Clarke provides a comprehensive 
guide to thematic analysis as a foundational method for qualitative research in 
psychology. The authors argue that despite its widespread use, thematic analysis has 
been poorly demarcated and often unacknowledged. The article offers a clear, step-by-
step process for conducting thematic analysis, discusses its theoretical flexibility, and 
distinguishes it from other qualitative methods like grounded theory and discourse 
analysis.

Abstract

Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely-acknowledged, yet widely-used 
qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an 
accessible and theoretically-flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline 
what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods 
that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and 
ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start 
thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider 
potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages 
and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis 
as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.

Using thematic analysis in psychology

Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated and rarely-acknowledged, yet widely-used 
qualitative analytic method (see Boyatzis, 1998; Roulston, 2001) within and beyond 
psychology. In this paper, we aim to fill what we, as researchers and teachers in 

qualitative psychology, have experienced as a current gap: the absence of a paper 
which adequately outlines the theory, application, and evaluation of thematic analysis, 
and one which does so in a way accessible to students and those not particularly 
familiar with qualitative research. That is, we aim to write a paper which will be useful as
both a teaching and research tool in qualitative psychology. Therefore, in this paper we 
discuss theory and method for thematic analysis, and clarify the similarities and 
differences between different approaches that share features in common with a 
thematic approach.

Qualitative approaches are incredibly diverse, complex and nuanced (Holloway & 
Todres, 2003), and thematic analysis should be seen as a foundational method for 
qualitative analysis. It is the first qualitative method of analysis that researchers should 
learn, as it provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many other forms of 
qualitative analysis. Indeed, Holloway and Todres (2003: 347) identify “thematizing 
meanings" as one of a few shared generic skills across qualitative analysis. For this 
reason, Boyatzis (1998) characterises it not as a specific method but as a tool to use 
across different methods. Similarly, Ryan and Bernard (2000) locate thematic coding as 
a process performed within ‘major' analytic traditions (such as grounded theory), rather
than a specific approach in its own right. We argue thematic analysis should be 
considered a method in its own right.

One of the benefits of thematic analysis is its flexibility. Qualitative analytic methods 
can be roughly divided into two camps. Within the first, there are those tied to, or 
stemming from, a particular theoretical or epistemological position. For some of these - 
such as conversation analysis ([CA] e.g., Hutchby & Wooffitt, 1998) and 
interpretative phenomenological analysis ([IPA] e.g., Smith & Osborn, 2003) - there 
is (as yet) relatively limited variability in how the method is applied, within that 
framework. In essence, one recipe guides analysis. For others of these - such as 
grounded theory (e.g., Glaser, 1992; Strauss & Corbin, 1998), discourse analysis 
([DA] e.g., Burman & Parker, 1993; Potter & Wetherell, 1987; Willig, 2003) or narrative 
analysis (e.g., Murray, 2003; Riessman, 1993) - there are different manifestations of 
the method, from within the broad theoretical framework. Second, there are methods 
that are essentially independent of theory and epistemology, and can be applied across 
a range of theoretical and epistemological approaches. Although often (implicitly) 
framed as a realist/experiential method (e.g., Aronson, 1994; Roulston, 2001), thematic
analysis is actually firmly in the second camp, and is compatible with both essentialist 
and constructionist paradigms within psychology (we discuss this later). Through its 
theoretical freedom, thematic analysis provides a flexible and useful research tool, 
which can potentially provide a rich and detailed, yet complex account of data.

Given the advantages of the flexibility of thematic analysis, it is important that we are 
clear that we are not trying to limit this flexibility. However, an absence of clear and 
concise guidelines around thematic analysis means that the 'anything goes' critique of 
qualitative research (Antaki, Billig, Edwards, & Potter, 2002) may well apply in some 
instances. With this paper, we hope to strike a balance between demarcating thematic 
analysis clearly - i.e., explaining what it is, and how you do it and ensuring flexibility in 
relation to how it is used, so that it does not become limited and constrained, and lose 

one of its key advantages. Indeed, a clear demarcation of this method will be useful to 
ensure that those who use thematic analysis can make active choices about the 
particular form of analysis they are engaged in. Therefore, this paper seeks to celebrate
the flexibility of the method, and provide a vocabulary and 'recipe' for people to start 
doing thematic analysis in a way that is theoretically and methodologically sound. As 
we will show, what is important is that as well as applying a method to data, researchers
make their (epistemological and other) assumptions explicit (Holloway & Todres, 2003). 
Qualitative psychologists need to be clear about what they are doing and why, and 
include the often-omitted 'how' they did their analysis in their reports (Attride-Stirling, 
2001).

In this paper we outline: what thematic analysis is; a 6-phase guide to doing thematic 
analysis; potential pitfalls to avoid when doing thematic analysis; what makes good 
thematic analysis; and advantages and disadvantages of thematic analysis. 
Throughout, we provide examples from the research literature, and our own research. 
By providing examples we show the types of research questions and topics that 
thematic analysis can be used to study.

Before we begin, we need to define a few of the terms used throughout the paper. Data 
corpus refers to all data collected for a particular research project, while data set refers
to all the data from the corpus that is being used for a particular analysis. Data item is 
used to refer to each individual piece of data collected, which together make up the data
set or corpus. Finally, data extract refers to an individual coded chunk of data, which 
has been identified within, and extracted from, a data item.

What is thematic analysis?

Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting patterns 
(themes) within data. It minimally organises and describes your data set in (rich) detail. 
However, it also often goes further than this, and interprets various aspects of the 
research topic (Boyatzis, 1998).

Thematic analysis is widely used, but there is no clear agreement about what 
thematic analysis is and how you go about doing it. It can be seen as a very poorly 
‘branded' method, in that it does not appear to exist as a 'named' analysis in the same 
way that other methods do. In this sense, it is often not explicitly claimed as the method 
of analysis, when, in actuality, we argue that a lot of analysis is essentially thematic - 
but is either claimed as something else (such as discourse analysis, or even content 
analysis) or not identified as any particular method at all. If we do not know how people
went about analysing their data, or what assumptions informed their analysis, it is 
difficult to evaluate their research.

Relatedly, insufficient detail is often given to reporting the process and detail of analysis 
(Attride-Stirling, 2001). It is not uncommon to read of themes 'emerging' from the data. 
An account of themes 'emerging' or being 'discovered' is a passive account of the 
process of analysis, and it denies the active role the researcher always plays in 

identifying patterns/themes, selecting which are of interest, and reporting them to the 
readers (Taylor & Ussher, 2001). The language of ‘themes emerging’:

Can be misinterpreted to mean that themes 'reside' in the data, and if we just
look hard enough they will 'emerge' like Venus on the half shell. If themes 
'reside' anywhere, they reside in our heads from our thinking about our data 
and creating links as we understand them. (Ely, Vinz, Downing, & Anzul, 
1997: 205-6)

Thematic analysis differs from other analytic methods that seek to describe patterns 
across qualitative data - such as 'thematic' discourse analysis, thematic 
decomposition analysis, IPA and grounded theory. Both IPA and grounded theory 
seek patterns in the data, but are theoretically bounded. IPA is wed to a 
phenomenological epistemology, which gives experience primacy (Holloway & Todres, 
2003), and is about understanding people's everyday experience of reality, in great 
detail. The goal of a grounded theory analysis is to generate a plausible - and useful - 
theory of the phenomena that is grounded in the data (McLeod, 2001). We argue, 
therefore, that a 'named and claimed' thematic analysis means researchers need not 
subscribe to the implicit theoretical commitments of grounded theory if they do not 
wish to produce a fully worked-up grounded-theory analysis.

In contrast to IPA or grounded theory, thematic analysis is not wed to any pre-
existing theoretical framework, and so it can be used within different theoretical 
frameworks (although not all), and can be used to do different things within them. 
Thematic analysis can be an essentialist or realist method, which reports 
experiences, meanings and the reality of participants, or it can be a constructionist 
method, which examines the ways in which events, realities, meanings, experiences 
and so on are the effects of a range of discourses operating within society. It can also 
be a 'contextualist' method, sitting between the two poles of essentialism and 
constructionism, and characterised by theories such as critical realism.

A number of decisions

Thematic analysis involves a number of choices which are often not made explicit, but 
which need explicitly to be considered and discussed.

What counts as a theme? A theme captures something important about the data in 
relation to the research question, and represents some level of patterned response or 
meaning within the data set. An important question to address in terms of coding is what
counts as a pattern/theme, or what 'size' does a theme need to be? This is a question of
prevalence. As this is qualitative analysis, there is no hard-and-fast answer. The 
'keyness' of a theme is not necessarily dependent on quantifiable measures - but in 
terms of whether it captures something important in relation to the overall research 
question.

A rich description of the data set, or a detailed account of one particular aspect. It
is important to determine the type of analysis you want to do. You might wish to provide 

a rich thematic description of your entire data set, so that the reader gets a sense of the 
predominant or important themes. An alternative use of thematic analysis is to provide 
a more detailed and nuanced account of one particular theme, or group of themes, 
within the data.

Inductive vs theoretical thematic analysis. Themes or patterns within data can be 
identified in one of two primary ways in thematic analysis: in an inductive or 'bottom 
up' way, or in a theoretical or deductive or 'top down' way. An inductive approach 
means the themes identified are strongly linked to the data themselves. In contrast, a 
'theoretical' thematic analysis would tend to be driven by the researcher's theoretical 
or analytic interest in the area, and is thus more explicitly analyst-driven.

Semantic or latent themes. Another decision revolves around the 'level' at which 
themes are to be identified: at a semantic or explicit level, or at a latent or 
interpretative level (Boyatzis, 1998). With a semantic approach, the themes are 
identified within the explicit or surface meanings of the data. In contrast, a thematic 
analysis at the latent level goes beyond the semantic content of the data, and starts to 
identify or examine the underlying ideas, assumptions, and conceptualisations - and 
ideologies - that are theorised as shaping or informing the semantic content of the data.

Epistemology: essentialist/realist vs constructionist thematic analysis. Thematic 
analysis can be conducted within both realist/essentialist and constructionist 
paradigms. The research epistemology guides what you can say about your data, and 
informs how you theorise meaning. With an essentialist/realist approach, you can 
theorise motivations, experience, and meaning in a straight-forward way. In contrast, 
from a constructionist perspective, meaning and experience are socially produced and
reproduced, rather than inhering within individuals.

Doing thematic analysis: a step-by-step guide

Analysis involves a constant moving back and forward between the entire data set, the 
coded extracts of data that you are analysing, and the analysis of the data that you are 
producing. Writing is an integral part of analysis, not something that takes place at the 
end. We provide an outline to guide you through the six phases of analysis.

Phase 1: familiarising yourself with your data

It is vital that you immerse yourself in the data to the extent that you are familiar with the
depth and breadth of the content. Immersion usually involves 'repeated reading' of the 
data, and reading the data in an active way - searching for meanings, patterns and so 
on. During this phase, it is a good idea to start taking notes or marking ideas for coding.

Phase 2: generating initial codes

This phase involves the production of initial codes from the data. Codes identify a 
feature of the data that appears interesting to the analyst. Work systematically through 
the entire data set, giving full and equal attention to each data item, and identify 
interesting aspects in the data items that may form the basis of repeated patterns 
(themes) across the data set.

Phase 3: searching for themes

This phase involves sorting the different codes into potential themes, and collating all 
the relevant coded data extracts within the identified themes. You are starting to 
analyse your codes, and consider how different codes may combine to form an 
overarching theme. It may be helpful at this phase to use visual representations like 
tables or mind-maps.

Phase 4: reviewing themes

This phase involves the refinement of those themes. It will become evident that some 
candidate themes are not really themes, while others might collapse into each other. 
Other themes might need to be broken down into separate themes. This phase involves
two levels of reviewing: at the level of the coded data extracts and in relation to the 
entire data set.

Phase 5: defining and naming themes

At this point, you then define and further refine the themes that you will present for your 
analysis, and analyse the data within them. By 'define and refine' we mean identifying 
the ‘essence' of what each theme is about, and determining what aspect of the data 
each theme captures. For each individual theme, you need to conduct and write a 
detailed analysis.

Phase 6: producing the report

This phase involves the final analysis and write-up of the report. The task is to tell the 
complicated story of your data in a way which convinces the reader of the merit and 
validity of your analysis. Your write-up must provide sufficient evidence of the themes 
within the data, using data extracts to illustrate and support an analysis that goes 
beyond mere description to make an argument in relation to your research question.

Potential pitfalls to avoid when doing thematic analysis

There are a number of things which can result in a poor analysis:

1. A failure to actually analyse the data at all. Thematic analysis is not just a 
collection of extracts strung together with little or no analytic narrative.

2. The using of the data collection questions (such as from an interview schedule) 

as the 'themes' that are reported.

3. A weak or unconvincing analysis, where the themes do not appear to work, 

where there is too much overlap between themes, or where the themes are not 
internally coherent and consistent.

4. A mismatch between the data and the analytic claims that are made about it. The

claims cannot be supported by the data.

5. A mismatch between theory and analytic claims, or between the research 

questions and the form of thematic analysis used.

What makes good thematic analysis?

Qualitative research provides methods of analysis that should be applied rigorously to 
the data. Criteria for conducting good qualitative research do exist. As thematic 
analysis is a flexible method, you also need to be clear and explicit about what you are 
doing, and what you say you are doing needs to match up with what you actually do.

Rigour lies in devising a systematic method whose assumptions are 
congruent with the way one conceptualises the subject matter. (Reicher & 
Taylor, 2005: 549)

So what does thematic analysis offer psychologists?

Thematic analysis is not a complex method. Its advantages are many. However, it is 
not without some disadvantages. Many of the disadvantages depend more on poorly 
conducted analyses or inappropriate research question, than on the method itself. The 
flexibility of the method can be a disadvantage in that it makes developing specific 
guidelines for higher-phase analysis difficult. Another issue is that a thematic analysis 
has limited interpretative power beyond mere description if it is not used within an 
existing theoretical framework that anchors the analytic claims that are made.

Finally, it is worth noting that thematic analysis currently has no particular kudos as an 
analytic method - this, we argue, stems from the very fact that it is poorly demarcated 
and claimed, yet widely used. We hope this paper will change this view, as, as we have 
argued, a rigorous thematic approach can produce an insightful analysis that answers 
particular research questions. What is important is choosing a method that is 
appropriate to your research question, rather than falling victim to 'methodolatry', 
where you are committed to method rather than topic/content or research questions 
(Holloway & Todres, 2003).
