DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a randomized controlled trial from 2001 that exemplifies the conventional 
medical model approach to childhood ADHD, comparing medication, multimodal therapy, and 
community-based treatments. While its "disorder-focused" framework is antithetical to Enlitens' 
mission, this paper is a critically important piece of evidence of the system Enlitens opposes. It 
provides a detailed, comprehensive list of the deficit-based, standardized assessment tools 
(e.g., Conners scales, Child Behavior Checklist) used to diagnose and measure outcomes in 
ADHD, showcasing exactly what the mainstream clinical and research world values and 
measures. The study's own results and limitations can be used to argue that these "gold 
standard" interventions, while reducing some "symptoms," often fail to produce meaningful, 
long-term improvements in areas like self-esteem and social functioning, thereby strengthening 
the case for a new, strengths-based paradigm.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENlitens

"Various treatments have been shown to be effective for children with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These include psychopharmacology (usually 
stimulants); parent management training; child psychotherapy focusing on social, academic, 
and problem-solving skills; and academic remediation and school-based interventions."

"Thus, in this study children with ADHD were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: (1) 
methylphenidate (MPH) alone; (2) multimodal (MM) treatment consisting of MPH, parent 
management training, child psychotherapy, and academic assistance; and (3) a community 
comparison (CC) group that was assessed and referred back to the community for treatment."

"In summary, this study indicates that, for children with ADHD, MM treatment is superior to 
routine CC treatment on various parent, teacher, academic, and child measures."

"However, on some measures (child self-reports of self-esteem and depression), no significant 
differences were found among the 3 groups. It is possible that for these variables either none of 
our treatments were effective or longer-term treatment is needed for changes to occur."

"The results of this study indicate that for children with ADHD, MM treatment is clearly superior 
to CC treatment and is generally (but not always) superior to MPH treatment."

"It is important to note, however, that even for the MM group, after 2 years of intensive 
treatment, various measures indicated that these children continued to have significant 
problems in many areas of functioning."

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

This study operates entirely within the Medical Model of Disability, specifically as it applies to 
ADHD.

● ADHD as a Disorder: ADHD is framed as a "disorder" with a constellation of negative 

symptoms that require "treatment". The goal of intervention is to reduce these symptoms
and move the child's functioning closer to a non-ADHD, neurotypical baseline.

● Pathology-Focused Intervention: The treatments evaluated are designed to target 

deficits. These include:

○ Psychopharmacology (Methylphenidate): To chemically manage symptoms of

inattention and hyperactivity.

○ Parent Management Training: To teach parents how to manage their child's 

"problem behaviors".

○ Child Psychotherapy: To teach the child skills they are presumed to be lacking 

(social, academic, problem-solving).

○ Academic Remediation: To address academic deficits.

● Quantification of Deficits: The success of the treatments is measured by quantifying 

changes in deficits using standardized, norm-referenced rating scales. A reduction in 
pathological scores is considered a successful outcome. There is no mention of 
identifying or measuring the child's strengths, interests, or unique cognitive style.

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS

Measures

The outcome measures were administered at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of treatment.
They assessed 4 domains of functioning: parent-child/family, teacher-child/school, academic, 
and child.

Parent-Child/Family Domain

● Parenting Stress Index (PSI): A 120-item parent self-report questionnaire assessing 

parental stress related to child and parent characteristics.

● Parent Practices Scale (PPS): A 33-item parent self-report questionnaire assessing 

parental discipline practices and parental warmth.

● Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL): A parent-report questionnaire assessing their child's

behavioral and emotional problems.

● Issues Checklist: A parent-report checklist assessing the number and intensity of 

parent-child conflicts in the past month.

● Parent Global Assessment: Parents rate their child's overall functioning on a scale of 1

to 5.

Teacher—Child/School Domain

● IOWA Conners Teacher Rating Scale: A 10-item questionnaire completed by the 

teacher assessing hyperactivity, inattention, and aggression.

● Teacher's Self-Control Rating Scale (SCRS): A 14-item teacher questionnaire 

assessing the child's self-control.

● Social Skills Rating System—Teacher (SSRS-T): A teacher-report questionnaire 
assessing a child's social skills (cooperation, assertion, self-control) and problem 
behaviors.

● Teacher Global Assessment: Teachers rate the child's overall functioning on a scale of

1 to 5.

Academic Domain

● Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT): Standardized test used to assess 

academic functioning in reading and mathematics.

● Academic Report: Parents bring in their child's most recent school report card, which is 

then coded on a 5-point scale.

Child Domain

● Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Revised (WISC-R): A standardized 

intelligence test providing Verbal, Performance, and Full-Scale IQ scores.

● Self-Perception Profile for Children (SPPC): A child self-report scale assessing 

perceived competence in scholastic and athletic domains, social acceptance, physical 
appearance, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth.

● Children's Depression Inventory (CDI): A child self-report questionnaire assessing 

depressive symptoms.

● Social Skills Rating System—Student (SSRS-S): A self-report questionnaire 

assessing a child's social skills.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS

The study population consisted of 91 children (80 boys, 11 girls) between the ages of 7 and 9.9 
years with a primary diagnosis of ADHD.

Key Treatment Outcomes after 2 Years:

● Teacher Ratings: On the IOWA Conners scale, both the Multimodal (MM) and 

Methylphenidate (MPH) groups showed significant improvement and were superior to 
the Community Comparison (CC) group. The MM group was also superior to the MPH 
group on the aggression subscale.

● Parent Ratings: On the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the MM group was superior to
the CC group on the externalizing (behavioral problems) scale and the total problem 
score. No significant differences were found between the MM and MPH groups.
● Academic Functioning: On the WIAT Reading Composite, the MM group showed 

significantly more improvement than both the MPH and CC groups.

● Child Self-Report: No significant differences were found among the three 

treatment groups on child self-reports of self-esteem (SPPC) or depression (CDI). 
This indicates that neither medication alone nor intensive multimodal therapy had a 
measurable impact on the children's core sense of self-worth or their internal emotional 
state over the two-year period.

Limitations of "Gold Standard" Treatments (as noted by the study)

Even with intensive, state-of-the-art intervention, the outcomes were limited.

● "It is important to note, however, that even for the MM group, after 2 years of intensive 
treatment, various measures indicated that these children continued to have significant 
problems in many areas of functioning."

● This suggests that the medical model's best available treatments manage some 

externally-observed behaviors but do not "cure" the "disorder" or necessarily lead to the 
child feeling better about themselves or functioning at the level of their non-ADHD peers.
The reliance on these methods alone leaves significant areas of a child's life and well-
being unaddressed.
