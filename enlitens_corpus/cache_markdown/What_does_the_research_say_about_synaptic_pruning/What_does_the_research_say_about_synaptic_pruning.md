Synaptic Pruning and Learning/Adaptation in the Adult Brain: A Comprehensive
Review

1. Introduction

Synaptic pruning—the selective elimination of synapses—is increasingly recognized as a dynamic and ongoing

process in the adult brain, not just a developmental phenomenon. Recent research demonstrates that synaptic

pruning, mediated by glial cells (especially microglia and astrocytes), is crucial for experience-dependent plasticity,

learning, memory formation, and cognitive adaptation throughout adulthood (Cornell et al., 2021; Morizawa et al.,

2022; Hösli et al., 2022; Basilico et al., 2021; Ball et al., 2022; Vardalaki et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Wang et al.,

2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022; De Luca et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020;

Basilico et al., 2022). Pruning helps refine neural circuits by removing less active or redundant synapses, thereby

enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of information processing. This process is tightly regulated by molecular

signals, neuronal activity, and glial-neuronal interactions, and is implicated in both healthy cognitive function and

the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders (Cornell et al., 2021; Morizawa et al.,

2022; Hösli et al., 2022; Basilico et al., 2021; Ball et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2021; Kurematsu et

al., 2022; De Luca et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020; Basilico et al., 2022). The

following review synthesizes the current understanding of synaptic pruning’s role in adult learning and adaptation,

highlighting key mechanisms, evidence, and open questions.

3. Results

3.1 Glial-Mediated Synaptic Pruning in Adult Plasticity

Microglia and astrocytes are central to synaptic pruning in the adult brain. Microglia monitor synaptic activity and

selectively engulf less active synapses via complement pathways (e.g., C1q, C3, CR3) and “Eat Me/Don’t Eat Me”

signals, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Cornell et al., 2021; Morizawa et al., 2022;

Hösli et al., 2022; Basilico et al., 2021; Ball et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020;

Sominsky et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020; Basilico et al., 2022). Astrocytes also modulate synaptic pruning and

plasticity through gap junctions, cytokine release (e.g., IL-33), and direct synaptic contact (Hösli et al., 2022; Wang

et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020). Disruption of glial function impairs synaptic homeostasis,

plasticity, and cognitive performance (Hösli et al., 2022; Basilico et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Kurematsu et al.,

2022; Liu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020).

3.2 Synaptic Pruning and Experience-Dependent Learning

Experience-dependent synaptic pruning is observed in multiple adult brain regions, including the hippocampus,

cortex, and cerebellum. Learning tasks (e.g., motor adaptation, spatial navigation) induce glial-mediated synaptic

engulfment, dendritic spine remodeling, and selective elimination of less active synapses, which are essential for
memory consolidation and circuit refinement (Morizawa et al., 2022; Schmidt et al., 2020; Vardalaki et al., 2022;

Donato et al., 2013; Kurematsu et al., 2022; De Luca et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020). Both the
formation of new synapses and the pruning of existing ones contribute to the dynamic reorganization of neural

circuits during learning (Schmidt et al., 2020; Vardalaki et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Kurematsu et al., 2022; De
Luca et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020).

3.3 Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms

Synaptic pruning in adulthood is regulated by a complex interplay of molecular signals, including complement

proteins, neurotrophic factors (e.g., BDNF, netrin-1), cytokines (e.g., IL-33), and neurotransmitter systems (e.g.,

dopamine, serotonin) (Cornell et al., 2021; Glasgow et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Johnstone & Mobley, 2020;
Wang et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Bijata et al., 2017). Activity-dependent mechanisms, such

as Hebbian plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), and long-term depression (LTD), interact with pruning

processes to shape synaptic strength and connectivity (Mansvelder et al., 2019; Donato et al., 2013; Piochon et al.,

2016; Yasuda et al., 2022; Bazzari & Parri, 2019; Zhang et al., 2021; Bijata et al., 2017; Fuchsberger & Paulsen, 2022).
Silent synapses and dendritic spine turnover provide a reservoir for circuit remodeling and learning in the adult

brain (Vardalaki et al., 2025; Vardalaki et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2020).

3.4 Synaptic Pruning in Health, Aging, and Disease

Proper synaptic pruning supports cognitive flexibility and memory, while dysregulation is linked to aging,

neurodegeneration, and psychiatric disorders (Cornell et al., 2021; Hösli et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Wang et
al., 2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022; Navakkode & Kennedy, 2024; De Luca et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et

al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Basilico et al., 2022). Excessive or insufficient pruning can impair

learning, memory, and adaptation, and is implicated in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and
depression (Cornell et al., 2021; Hösli et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022;

Navakkode & Kennedy, 2024; De Luca et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020;

Zhang et al., 2021; Basilico et al., 2022). Manipulating glial activity or pruning pathways is being explored as a

therapeutic strategy for cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection (Cornell et al., 2021; Morizawa et al., 2022;
Hösli et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et al.,

2018; Nguyen et al., 2020; Basilico et al., 2022).

4. Discussion

The evidence robustly supports that synaptic pruning is an active, regulated process in the adult brain, essential for

learning, memory, and adaptation (Cornell et al., 2021; Morizawa et al., 2022; Hösli et al., 2022; Basilico et al., 2021;
Ball et al., 2022; Vardalaki et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022; De Luca et al.,

2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020; Basilico et al., 2022). Glial cells, especially

microglia and astrocytes, are key mediators, responding to neuronal activity and experience to sculpt neural

circuits (Cornell et al., 2021; Morizawa et al., 2022; Hösli et al., 2022; Basilico et al., 2021; Ball et al., 2022; Wang et

al., 2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020; Basilico et al., 2022).

Pruning is tightly linked to synaptic plasticity mechanisms (LTP, LTD, Hebbian rules), and both the elimination and

formation of synapses are required for optimal cognitive function (Mansvelder et al., 2019; Vardalaki et al., 2022;
Donato et al., 2013; Piochon et al., 2016; Yasuda et al., 2022; Bazzari & Parri, 2019; Zhang et al., 2021; Bijata et al.,

2017; Fuchsberger & Paulsen, 2022). The presence of silent synapses and ongoing dendritic spine turnover in adults

provides a substrate for rapid circuit remodeling and learning (Vardalaki et al., 2025; Vardalaki et al., 2022; Xu et al.,

2020).

However, the relationship between synaptic pruning and behavior is complex. While pruning is necessary for

certain types of learning and memory, not all forms of cognitive adaptation require extensive synaptic elimination

(Basilico et al., 2022). The balance between pruning and synaptic stabilization is critical; dysregulation can lead to

cognitive deficits or neuropsychiatric disease (Cornell et al., 2021; Hösli et al., 2022; Donato et al., 2013; Wang et

al., 2021; Kurematsu et al., 2022; Navakkode & Kennedy, 2024; De Luca et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Sominsky et
al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Basilico et al., 2022). There are also open questions about the

specificity of pruning mechanisms across brain regions, cell types, and learning paradigms.

5. Conclusion

Synaptic pruning is a dynamic, experience-dependent process in the adult brain, essential for learning, memory,
and adaptation. Glial cells orchestrate the selective elimination and maintenance of synapses, enabling flexible and

efficient neural circuit function. Dysregulation of pruning contributes to cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric

disease, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention.
