DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This chapter by Owens, Zalecki, and Hinshaw details the findings from the Berkeley Girls with 
ADHD Longitudinal Study (BGALS), a landmark prospective study of a large, diverse sample of 
girls with ADHD followed from childhood into young adulthood. This research is fundamentally 
important to Enlitens' mission because it provides extensive, multi-method, multi-informant 
evidence that ADHD in females is a severe and persistent condition with unique developmental 
pathways and outcomes, particularly an alarming risk for self-harm. The study's findings reveal 
the inadequacy of relying on self-report for diagnosis and underscore how male-prototyped 
understandings of ADHD have led to the historical neglect and mischaracterization of the 
condition in females, making a powerful case for the kind of nuanced, developmentally-informed
clinical assessment Enlitens advocates for.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENLITENS

● "Believed to be a male disorder for much of the 20th century, only recently has 

recognition been given to the reality of ADHD in girls and women."

● "At that time, the ratio of boys-to-girls with ADHD presenting for services was between 

5:1 and 10:1 (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), thus leading to the erroneous 
assumption that ADHD in girls is rare."

● "The primary take-home message from these BGALS findings is that during childhood, 

adolescence, and young adulthood, in almost every psychosocial and 
neuropsychological domain we investigated, females with ADHD show sizable 
disadvantages and deficits relative to females without ADHD."

● "The sheer range of negative outcomes is noteworthy. Our findings affirm the public 
health significance of ADHD in girls, given the likelihood of persisting symptoms and 
(especially) impairment in crucial domains."

● "Impairments among girls and women with ADHD were particularly salient in the BGALS 
when outcomes were reported by parents or teachers and were less likely when self-
reported."

● "Contrary to these expectations, adults with ADHD continued to under-report their 

symptoms. Parent-reported symptomatology, on the other hand, remained higher than 
self-reports and correlated well with functional impairments."

CRITIQUE OF CURRENT ASSESSMENT & 
RESEARCH PRACTICES

Historical Neglect and Sampling Bias

The study was founded on the principle that research on ADHD was fundamentally flawed due 
to its near-exclusive focus on males.

● "The project was proposed against a backdrop of a long, uphill battle that had been 
fought (and, indeed, is still being fought) for clinical and research recognition of the 
presence and impact of ADHD in females."

● "At the time of the initial BGALS grant proposal, exceedingly few girls with ADHD had 
been investigated via multimethod and multi-informant research protocols, much less 
followed longitudinally for the purpose of understanding their developmental trajectories."

● "One key reason was that most ADHD researchers typically recruited clinically referred 
participants. At that time, the ratio of boys-to-girls with ADHD presenting for services 
was between 5:1 and 10:1... thus leading to the erroneous assumption that ADHD in 
girls is rare."

● "Additional important features of the BGALS were its ethnic mix (most of the participants 
with ADHD up to that point had been Caucasian) and its nonreliance on exclusively 
clinically referred participants."

The Unreliability of Self-Report in Assessment

A consistent finding across the study's multiple follow-ups is the significant under-reporting of 
symptoms and impairment by girls and women with ADHD themselves, highlighting the danger 
of relying on self-report questionnaires for diagnosis.

● "Due to the well-established under-reporting of symptoms and impairment by children 

with ADHD (Owens et al., 2007), the PALS always has included additional informant 
reports of functioning."

● "Girls with childhood ADHD self-reported lower academic and social competence and 

higher levels of eating disorder and depressive symptoms at W2, but their self-reported 
substance use, delinquent behavior, and number of delinquent peers were equivalent to 
reports from the comparison girls."

● "Relatedly, if we had used youth-report on the DISC-IV to diagnose ADHD during young 
adulthood, only about one fifth of the girls originally diagnosed with ADHD would have 

retained that diagnosis, in comparison with the well over half who did when based 
primarily on parent-report on the DISC IV."

● "Contrary to these expectations, adults with ADHD continued to under-report their 

symptoms. Parent-reported symptomatology, on the other hand, remained higher than 
self-reports and correlated well with functional impairments."

● "This has important implications for clinical decisions such that the under-reporting of 
symptoms by adults with ADHD must be considered while making diagnostic and 
treatment decisions. Moreover, there may be a need for additional observer evidence to 
determine true functioning levels."

METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS (BGALS)

A Multi-Method, Multi-Informant Assessment Protocol

The BGALS study design serves as a model for a comprehensive assessment that goes far 
beyond simple checklists, aligning with the principles of a thorough clinical evaluation.

● Longitudinal Design: Data was collected at Wave 1 (childhood, ages 6-12), Wave 2 

(adolescence, ages 11-18), and Wave 3 (young adulthood, ages 17-24).

● Multi-Gated Screening: The study used a rigorous process to identify participants, 

starting with over 1,200 initial callers and using phone screens, parent/teacher rating 
scales (SNAP-IV, CBCL/TRF), and finally a full diagnostic evaluation with the DISC-IV 
interview and WISC-III IQ test.

● Multiple Informants: Data was collected from parents (primary and secondary 

caregivers), teachers, peers, observers, and the participants themselves.

● Naturalistic Observation: An intensive 5-week summer research program was used at 
baseline to "allow collection of naturalistic, ecologically valid data from observers and 
peers regarding the behavioral and social functioning," including peer sociometrics and 
daily behavior observations. Staff were blind to participants' diagnostic status.

● Comprehensive Domains: Assessment covered 11 primary domains: demographics, 
ADHD diagnosis/symptoms, externalizing problems, internalizing problems, global 
impairment, neuropsychological performance, school achievement, well-being, peer 
relations, service utilization, and parenting.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC FINDINGS 
(FEMALES WITH ADHD)

Persistence of ADHD into Adulthood

● "Overall, of those with childhood ADHD who were followed up during adolescence, 69% 

continued to meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for some form of ADHD."

● Using DSM-IV criteria, 58% of girls with childhood ADHD retained the diagnosis in young

adulthood.

● Using updated DSM-5 criteria (requiring 5 symptoms instead of 6),

 76.6% of those with a childhood diagnosis retained the diagnosis during young 
adulthood.

Severe Impairments Across the Lifespan

● Childhood (Wave 1): Girls with ADHD showed significant impairments with medium-to-
very-large effect sizes, including psychiatric comorbidities, lower cognitive performance 
(though still in the average range), and noteworthy peer rejection.

● Adolescence (Wave 2): "girls with childhood-diagnosed ADHD continued to show 

greater psychiatric symptomatology across multiple domains... and larger functional 
impairments... than did comparison girls".

● Young Adulthood (Wave 3): "Across most domains during young adulthood, girls with 
Wave 1 ADHD diagnoses were significantly more symptomatic and impaired than the 
comparison group, with effect sizes ranging from medium to very large."

Alarming Rates of Self-Harm and Suicidality

This is a key finding, distinguishing the female ADHD experience and highlighting the life-
threatening stakes of under-diagnosis.

● "Significant ADHD-C versus ADHD-I differences at W3 were rarely found, with the 
important exception of self-injury and suicide attempts, which predominated in the 
childhood-diagnosed combined type."

● Suicide Attempts: Reported by 22% of girls with childhood ADHD-Combined type, 

versus 8% of girls with ADHD-Inattentive type and 6% of comparison girls.

● Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI): Over half (51%) of the girls with ADHD-Combined type 
had engaged in moderate to severe levels of NSSI, significantly higher than the ADHD-
Inattentive subgroup (29%) or the comparison girls (19%).

● Mediators: Adolescent internalizing problems mediated the link between childhood 

ADHD and later suicide attempts, while adolescent externalizing problems mediated the 
link to NSSI. Maltreatment was also a major predictor.

ADHD Subtype Differences

While the two ADHD presentations (Combined and Inattentive) were largely similar in outcomes,
the Combined type was associated with more severe externalizing issues.

● "Inattentive versus comparison subtype contrasts were not commonly significant."
● Key distinctions for the ADHD-Combined group included "higher rates of previous 

maltreatment, summer-program peer rejection, and rates and levels of comorbid 
externalizing problems".

● "The key subtype distinctions were higher rates of externalizing and peer problems 
during childhood and adolescence, and higher rates of self-harm during young 
adulthood, among those with ADHD-C compared with those with ADHD-I.”
