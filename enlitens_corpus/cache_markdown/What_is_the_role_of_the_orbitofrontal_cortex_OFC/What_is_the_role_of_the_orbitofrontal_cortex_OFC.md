Yes, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucial for evaluating value and assessing the
credibility of messages by integrating sensory, emotional, and contextual
information to guide adaptive decision-making.

1. Introduction

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a key region in the ventral frontal lobe, extensively studied for its role in value-

based decision-making, reward processing, and adaptive behavior. Recent research has expanded its functional

repertoire to include the evaluation of message value and credibility, integrating sensory, emotional, and contextual

cues to inform judgments and choices (Schoenbaum et al., 2011; Rudebeck & Rich, 2018; Knudsen & Wallis, 2022;

Banerjee et al., 2020; Masset et al., 2020; Rich & Wallis, 2016; Zhou et al., 2020; Rolls, 2023; Wang et al., 2020;

Howard et al., 2015). The OFC encodes subjective value signals, tracks prediction errors, and supports flexible

updating of beliefs and preferences, making it central to evaluating the trustworthiness and relevance of

information, including persuasive messages and social cues (Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Masset et al., 2020; Zhou et

al., 2020; Rolls, 2023; Howard et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015). This review synthesizes evidence from

neurophysiological, neuroimaging, lesion, and behavioral studies to clarify the OFC’s role in evaluating value and

credibility, highlighting its interactions with other prefrontal and limbic regions and its importance for both

economic and social decision-making (Rudebeck & Rich, 2018; Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Zhou et al., 2020; Rolls,

2023; Howard et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015; Murray & Rudebeck, 2018; Gottfried et al., 2003; Azzi et al., 2012).

2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across more than 170 million research papers in Consensus, including

Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and related sources. The search targeted the OFC’s role in value and credibility

evaluation, message processing, and decision-making. In total, 1,026 papers were identified, 587 were screened,

382 were deemed eligible, and the 50 most relevant papers were included in this review.

3. Results

3.1. OFC as a Value and Credibility Evaluator

The OFC encodes the subjective value of anticipated outcomes, integrating sensory, emotional, and contextual

information to guide optimal decision-making (Schoenbaum et al., 2011; Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Masset et al.,

2020; Rich & Wallis, 2016; Zhou et al., 2020; Rolls, 2023; Howard et al., 2015; Hirokawa et al., 2019; Kimmel et al.,

2020; Gottfried et al., 2003). It is especially critical when evaluating the credibility of messages or when outcome

information is uncertain or must be inferred (Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Zhou et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Howard

et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015; Murray & Rudebeck, 2018).

3.2. Mechanisms of Value Representation

OFC neurons fire in proportion to the value of anticipated outcomes, and their activity reflects both the identity and

desirability of rewards or information (Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Masset et al., 2020; Rich & Wallis, 2016; Yamada et

al., 2018; Howard et al., 2015; Hirokawa et al., 2019; Kimmel et al., 2020; Gottfried et al., 2003). The OFC supports

flexible updating of value representations in response to new evidence or changing contingencies, a process

essential for evaluating message credibility (Schoenbaum et al., 2011; Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Banerjee et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2020; Rolls, 2023; Wang et al., 2020; Howard et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015; Hirokawa et al., 2019;

Kimmel et al., 2020; Noonan et al., 2017; Sadacca et al., 2018).

3.3. OFC and Social/Message Credibility

The OFC is activated during the evaluation of persuasive messages, social cues, and peer recommendations,

linking internal preferences with external information to assess credibility and trustworthiness (Zhou et al., 2020;

Alsharif et al., 2021; Rolls, 2023; Howard et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015; Watson & Platt, 2012; Murray & Rudebeck,
2018; Bellucci & Park, 2023; Gottfried et al., 2003; Azzi et al., 2012). It interacts with regions such as the

ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala to process emotional and motivational aspects of message evaluation

(Rudebeck & Rich, 2018; Zhou et al., 2020; Rolls, 2023; Howard et al., 2015; Murray & Rudebeck, 2018; Gottfried et
al., 2003; Azzi et al., 2012).

3.4. Functional Heterogeneity and Network Interactions

Distinct OFC subregions (medial vs. lateral) contribute differently to value assignment, credit assignment, and

decision-making, with evidence for both domain-general and specialized functions (Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Zhou

et al., 2020; Howard et al., 2015; Gourley et al., 2016; Noonan et al., 2017; Murray & Rudebeck, 2018; Gottfried et
al., 2003; Azzi et al., 2012; Moneta et al., 2024). The OFC works in concert with the hippocampus, dorsolateral

prefrontal cortex, and limbic structures to support model-based inference and context-dependent evaluation

(Wang et al., 2020; Howard et al., 2015; Farovik et al., 2015; Fengjun et al., 2025; Sadacca et al., 2018; Moneta et al.,

2024).

4. Discussion

The OFC is robustly implicated in evaluating the value and credibility of messages, integrating diverse information

streams to guide adaptive behavior (Schoenbaum et al., 2011; Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Masset et al., 2020; Rich &

Wallis, 2016; Zhou et al., 2020; Rolls, 2023; Howard et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015; Hirokawa et al., 2019; Kimmel et

al., 2020; Gottfried et al., 2003). Its role extends beyond simple value coding to include the representation of

cognitive maps, model-based inference, and metacognitive confidence, all of which are essential for assessing the

trustworthiness and relevance of information (Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Masset et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Wang
et al., 2020; Howard et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015; Hirokawa et al., 2019; Kimmel et al., 2020; Fengjun et al., 2025;

Sadacca et al., 2018; Gottfried et al., 2003; Moneta et al., 2024). The OFC’s functional heterogeneity allows for

flexible assignment of value and credit, with medial and lateral subregions supporting distinct aspects of decision-

making (Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Zhou et al., 2020; Howard et al., 2015; Gourley et al., 2016; Noonan et al., 2017;

Murray & Rudebeck, 2018; Gottfried et al., 2003; Azzi et al., 2012; Moneta et al., 2024). However, methodological

challenges remain, including anatomical variability, task design limitations, and the need for more ecologically valid

paradigms to capture real-world message evaluation (Knudsen & Wallis, 2022; Zhou et al., 2020; Rolls, 2023;
Howard et al., 2015; Cascio et al., 2015; Murray & Rudebeck, 2018; Gottfried et al., 2003; Azzi et al., 2012; Moneta

et al., 2024).

5. Conclusion

The OFC is a central neural hub for evaluating the value and credibility of messages, integrating sensory, emotional,

and contextual information to guide adaptive decision-making. Its flexible, context-sensitive coding supports both

economic and social judgments, with distinct subregions and network interactions underpinning its diverse

functions.

5.1. Research Gaps

Despite substantial progress, gaps remain in understanding the OFC’s precise causal mechanisms, its role in real-

world message evaluation, and its interactions with other brain regions during complex social and economic
decisions.

5.2. Open Research Questions

Future research should address the following questions to advance understanding of the OFC’s role in value and

credibility evaluation:

Question

Why

How does the OFC evaluate message credibility
in real-world, ecologically valid contexts?

Laboratory tasks may not capture the complexity of real-
world message evaluation, limiting generalizability.

What are the causal effects of OFC disruption on
value and credibility judgments?

Lesion and stimulation studies can clarify the necessity and
sufficiency of OFC involvement.

How do OFC subregions interact with other brain
areas during complex decision-making?

Understanding network-level dynamics is crucial for
modeling adaptive social and economic behavior.

In summary, the OFC is essential for evaluating the value and credibility of messages, but further research is

needed to delineate its specific mechanisms, subregional functions, and real-world relevance.
