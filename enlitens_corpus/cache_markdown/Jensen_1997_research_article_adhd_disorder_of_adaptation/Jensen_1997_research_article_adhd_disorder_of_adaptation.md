DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This document is a foundational scientific article by Jensen et al. (1997) that proposes 
an evolutionary and adaptational framework for understanding 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Instead of viewing ADHD solely as 
a deficit or dysfunction, the authors argue that its core traits—inattention (as rapid 
scanning), hyperactivity (as increased motor exploration), and impulsivity (as quick 
response)—can be seen as adaptive responses that would have been advantageous in 
ancestral environments. They introduce the concept of a "response-ready" individual, 
optimized for dangerous or resource-scarce settings, who may be poorly matched to 
modern environments like classrooms. This perspective reframes ADHD as a disorder 
of adaptation or "fit" rather than a simple pathology, with significant implications for 
treatment and research.

ABSTRACT

Current knowledge about early plasticity and children's responsiveness to 
environmental modifications as well as the atheoretical nature of current nosological 
systems necessitate alternative models to explain the phenomena of childhood 
behavioral and emotional disturbances. Evolutionary biology provides one such 
framework... Through an evolutionary biological lens, some mental disorders are better 
viewed as an adaptive response to early pathogenic environments and/or reflect the 

optimization of brain function to some environments at the cost of poorer response to 
the demands of other environments. As an example, the authors examine attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in relation to evolutionary theories of 
psychology and biology and clarify the potentially adaptive nature of characteristics of 
inattention, impulsivity, and motoric hyperactivity, depending on the nature of child's 
environments.

Introduction

Despite the popularity and widespread use of the DSM-IV, concerns persist among 
clinicians and the general public about the applicability of "mental disorder" status to 
some described conditions. Early environmental experiences impact structural and 
functional aspects of cortical development... consequently, some DSM-defined 
"disorders" plausibly arise from an adaptive response to early pathogenic 
environments (trauma, neglect), while others result from the optimization of brain 
function to early environments that are inconsistent with the demands that the child 
must meet in later environments.

Evolutionary Biology and Human Adaptation

When human mental and behavioral phenomena are viewed from this theoretical 
perspective, a core assumption holds that natural selection has shaped the mental 
mechanisms available to our species and that these mental mechanisms enhance 
adaptation and survival.

Thus, many emotional and behavioral responses (particularly if relatively 
common-place within a given species) may not just be "symptoms" of 
disorders, but they might instead reflect adaptive responses of the organism 
to environmental demands. From this vantage point, the human brain can be
viewed as an "adaptation machine," evolved to fit our species to a range of 
environments.

Application of Evolutionary Models to ADHD

Given the current estimated frequency of ADHD (3% to 5%), it is unlikely that such a 
"disorder" could be as prevalent in the human species if not maintained within the 
species by selection forces that conveyed certain advantages to some ADHD 
characteristics or other associated traits. ADHD is characterized as a classical triad of 
symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity... we suggest that each of these 
"symptoms" can be adaptive in some instances.

● Increased Motor Activity (Hyperactivity): For an organism to adapt 

successfully, it must constantly explore the environment for threats and 
opportunities. From this perspective, increased motor behavior and hyperactivity 
may be useful (particularly in ancestral hunter-gatherer environments) to assist in
effective foraging, spotting of new opportunities, anticipating dangers, etc.

● Attentional Processes (Scanning and Rapidly Shifting Attention): Vigilance 
is necessary to monitor dangers and threats. Overfocused attention could be 

quite maladaptive in high-threat or highly novel environments... Thus according 
to our conceptualization, animals who are preyed upon or are in environments 
with a high ratio of predators to prey are more likely to have increased scanning 
behaviors.

● Impulsivity: For purposes of our thesis, we define impulsivity as an organism's 

quick response to environmental cues while not considering alternative 
responses... The organism that does not quickly pounce on a potential prey or 
dodge a potential predator may not get another chance. The relative danger of 
false-positive responses... could be easily outweighed by the "downsides" of 
missing a critical cue in dangerous or resource-scare environments.

Nature of Ancestral Environments

Converging evidence from anthropology and archaeology indicates that the human 
species diverged from forebears by living for a few million years in hunter-gatherer 
societies. Foraging was essential... threats abounded. Yet human culture and society 
have changed dramatically in the last 10,000 years, more rapid by far than the pace of 
evolution of the human genome. A lag in remodeling the genome means that our 
species' brains still retain the propensity to adapt to environmental features as these 
were before the emergence of recent civilizations.

We suggest that ancestral environments ranged along several continua, including safe 
versus not safe, resource-rich versus impoverished, and time-optional versus time-
critical. At one end of these three continua (which we will term "response-ready"), 
humans' survival depended on being (1) hypervigilant... (2) rapid-scanning; (3) quick to 
pounce (or flee); and (4) motorically "hyperactive". The "response-ready" individual 
would likely have been advantaged under the brutal or harsh circumstances of the 
frozen steppe or humid jungle, whereas the excessively contemplative, more phlegmatic
individual would have been "environmentally challenged."

As society has become increasingly industrialized and organized, "response-ready" 
characteristics may have become less adaptive... Success in such environments 
becomes increasingly measured by the ability to demonstrate (1) problem-solving and 
analytic strategies, (2) restraint of impulsivity, and (3) the controlled deployment of 
energies. For purposes of our argument, such an individual will be termed "problem-
solving."

Clinical Implications

Viewed from an evolutionary, adaptational perspective, our current school 
environments could hardly be more difficult for the "response-ready" child. 
Most of them demand attentional focus and motoric passivity, while 
presenting complex stimuli.

Individual variations along the dimensions of "response-ready" versus "problem-
solving" may coincide with environmental variations in a way that produces either good 
or bad fit for a particular child.

In reframing the child who has ADHD as "response-ready," experience-seeking, or 
alert and curious, the clinician can counsel the child and family to recognize situations in
modern society that might favor such an individual, both in terms of school 
environments, as well as future career opportunities, e.g., athlete, air-traffic-controller, 
salesperson, soldier, or entrepreneur.

In considering treatments for a given child, clinicians should be aware that the child's 
ADHD “symptoms" may be adaptive in some settings but not others. From this 
perspective, the complaints of some children and parents that stimulant medications 
make the child seem too sedated, less social, or "not himself" are understandable.

Research Implications

A major implication of the above ADHD model suggests that more study of the 
individual components (attention, motor activity, and impulsivity) as specific traits may 
be warranted. Breaking the syndrome into its specific behavioral components might 
more easily allow cross-species comparisons of these traits.

We need further study of the effects of children's early environments on the 
development of "response-ready" traits, as well as the malleability of these 
characteristics. In this context, what is the impact on children's attentional systems of 
watching television and playing video games?

Our hypothetical model of ADHD suggests that more studies of the boundaries between
illness and health, and what constitutes a "disorder," are needed. Indeed, recent 
findings from the largest genetic twin study of ADHD conducted to date suggest that 
ADHD is best characterized as a trait distributed normally throughout the population 
(Levy et al., 1997). But at which point should a mismatch between persons and 
environments be designated as a medical psychiatric disorder?
