DOCUMENT SUMMARY

This paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness and successful implementation of 
Peer Instruction (PI), an alternative, interactive teaching method that challenges traditional 
lecture formats. For Enlitens, this research serves as a powerful analogue and strategic 
roadmap for replacing a traditional, passive methodology (standardized testing) with an 
interactive, collaborative one (the Enlitens Interview). The paper demonstrates that alternative 
methods can yield superior results and achieve high user satisfaction, and, most importantly, it 
offers a detailed guide to overcoming the exact types of institutional, peer, and client resistance 
that Enlitens faces.

CRITICAL QUOTES FOR ENlitens

● "Correspondence and informal discussions indicate a user base of hundreds of 

instructors around the world who teach with PI, yet to date there has been no systematic
study of PI implementation and effectiveness in the variety of settings in which it is 
used."

● "Thus, the vast majority of instructors completing our survey consider their experiences 

with PI to be successful."

● "Many successful users of Peer Instruction indicate that they had to overcome a number 

of challenges, which we describe here along with solutions suggested by the 
respondents."

● "Ten percent of respondents report that their colleagues are skeptical of the benefit of 

student discussions that take away lecture time."

● "A third of these instructors report addressing this skepticism by collecting data on 

student learning gains."

● "Because most students are unaccustomed to active participation in science classes, 

some feel uncomfortable participating in discussions, or initially consider the discussions
a waste of time."

● "Persistence in using Peer Instruction in the face of initial student resistance is 

important..."

● "In summary, the PI survey results indicate that most of the assessed PI courses 

produce learning gains commensurate with interactive engagement pedagogies, and 
more than 300 instructors (greater than 80%) consider their implementation of Peer 
Instruction to be successful."

● "Over 90% of those using the method plan to continue or expand their use of PI."

KEY STATISTICS & EVIDENCE

● Survey Size: More than 700 instructors completed a survey, with 384 identified as using

Peer Instruction (PI).

● User Satisfaction: Of 384 PI users, 303 definitely planned to use PI again, and 29 

probably would. Only seven respondents had no plans to use PI again. Over 90% of 
users plan to continue or expand their use of PI.

● Quantitative Effectiveness (FCI Scores): 81% of PI users who collected quantitative 

data used the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).

● Normalized Gain: The average normalized gain, g, for 30 courses taught with PI was 

0.39 ± 0.09.

● Comparison to Traditional Methods: Hake's survey of FCI data defines a "medium-g" 
range (g=0.3 to 0.7) where 85% of interactive engagement courses fall, while none of 
the traditionally taught courses do.

● PI Performance: 27 out of 30 (90%) of the PI courses in this survey fell into the 

"medium-g" range, demonstrating learning gains consistent with effective interactive 
engagement pedagogies.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

Peer Instruction (PI) as an Alternative Pedagogy

Peer Instruction (PI) is a widely used pedagogy in which lectures are interspersed with short 
conceptual questions (ConcepTests) designed to reveal common misunderstandings and to 
actively engage students in lecture courses. The language of the survey was purposely broad in
order to include instructors who had used a strategy similar to PI without being aware of our 
work; we therefore received responses from many instructors using other collaborative learning 
strategies.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Peer Instruction Challenges and Solutions

Many successful users of Peer Instruction indicate that they had to overcome a number of 
challenges, which we describe here along with solutions suggested by the respondents.

● Challenge: Time and Energy to Develop Materials Thirteen percent of instructors cite 
the time and energy required to develop ConcepTests as an impediment to using PI. 
Developing good ConcepTests certainly takes a great deal of effort; to minimize 
duplication of this effort, and to make PI easier to implement, we and other developers of
ConcepTests have made online databases of ConcepTests for introductory physics, 
chemistry, and astronomy freely available.

● Challenge: Colleague Skepticism Ten percent of respondents report that their 

colleagues are skeptical of the benefit of student discussions that take away lecture 
time. A third of these instructors report addressing this skepticism by collecting data on 
student learning gains. One particularly effective approach is to compare achievement of
students taught with and without PI on identical exams. Others suggest inviting skeptical 
colleagues to sit in on a class, sharing positive student feedback with them, or even 
giving the assessment tests to other faculty.

● Challenge: Time Constraints and Curriculum Coverage About 9% of respondents 
report that the quantity of material to cover in a semester often makes it difficult to 
devote class time to ConcepTests. One-tenth of these instructors reduce the amount of 
material covered by the course, but the majority do not have the freedom to do so. One 
option for those bound by a lengthy syllabus is to require students to learn some of the 
material on their own, especially by assigning reading of the text before class.
● Challenge: Student Resistance to the Method Another challenge is students' 
resistance to the method (7% of respondents). Because most students are 
unaccustomed to active participation in science classes, some feel uncomfortable 
participating in discussions, or initially consider the discussions a waste of time. Thus, 
respondents report that it is essential to thoroughly explain the use of PI to their 
students. Persistence in using Peer Instruction in the face of initial student resistance is 
important; 15 (4%) users report that, while their students were initially skeptical of PI, the
students warmed up to it as they found the method helped them learn the material. 
Regularly presenting class-averaged data on student performance also shows students 
that the method is helping them and thus may also motivate students.

● Challenge: Engaging All Students A related challenge is the difficulty in fully engaging 
students in class discussions (7% of respondents). In the words of one instructor, "some 
students were too cool, too alienated, or perhaps too lost to participate". Nearly half of 
those citing this challenge say it is important for the instructor to circulate through the 
classroom during the group discussion of the ConcepTest, helping to guide and 
encourage students in discussion. Other students may be motivated by receiving credit 
for participation and by the presence of ConcepTest-like conceptual questions on 
exams.
