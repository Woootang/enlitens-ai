# Enlitens AI - Comprehensive Fixes for Empty Field Issue

## Date: 2025-10-29
## Issue: 80%+ of knowledge base fields coming back empty

---

## ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Schema Mismatch** (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Agent prompts asked for field names that didn't exist in Pydantic schemas
- **Example**: Clinical agent asked for "treatment_approaches" but schema expected "interventions"
- **Impact**: LLM generated correct content but validation failed, resulting in empty output

### 2. **Incomplete Prompts** (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Prompts only asked for 3-5 fields when schemas had 8 fields
- **Example**: Clinical prompt asked for 5 fields, schema had 8
- **Impact**: Even when LLM succeeded, 3 fields were always empty

### 3. **Overly Strict Validation** (HIGH)
- **Problem**: Validation failed if ALL lists were empty, even if partial data existed
- **Impact**: Rejected partial but valid extractions

### 4. **Missing Agents** (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Educational Content and Rebellion Framework agents didn't exist
- **Impact**: 100% of those fields were always empty

### 5. **Temperature Too Low** (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: Temperature 0.3-0.4 caused conservative/empty responses
- **Impact**: LLM played it safe and returned empty arrays

### 6. **Insufficient Context** (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: Only first 5000 chars of document provided to agents
- **Impact**: Limited information available for extraction

- ✅ Added comprehensive extraction guidelines ("extract liberally", "infer from context")
- ✅ Increased temperature from 0.4 to 0.7
- ✅ Added document context (8000 chars instead of implicit)
- ✅ Added clear instructions to generate 3-8 items per field

**Impact:** Should go from ~5% populated to 60-80% populated

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Test with Sample Document:
```bash
# Run processing on a single test document
python process_multi_agent_corpus.py --test-mode --single-document test.pdf

# Check output quality

## CONCLUSION

These fixes address the root causes of empty fields:
