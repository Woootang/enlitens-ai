  "monitoring": "COMPREHENSIVE guide to what to monitor during treatment implementation with complete detail on when and how to adjust. Cover: Progress indicators - what improvement looks like (e.g., 'expect gradual reduction in depression scores, with clinically significant change being 10+ point reduction on BDI-II by week 8 based on study findings; if no improvement by week 4, consider increasing session frequency or adding adjunctive treatment'), Trajectories of change - when to expect improvement (e.g., 'study showed steady improvement across 8 weeks, with some patients showing early gains by week 2-3 and others improving more gradually'), Safety monitoring - what adverse events or worsening to watch for (e.g., 'monitor for increased suicidal ideation, especially in first 2-4 weeks when behavioral activation may increase energy before mood improves; assess at each session using direct questions'), Adherence tracking - how to monitor engagement (e.g., 'track homework completion as predictor of outcomes; if patient completes <50% of homework, problem-solve barriers'), Session attendance - what patterns indicate problems (e.g., 'frequent cancellations or lateness may indicate ambivalence, practical barriers, or worsening symptoms'), When to adjust treatment - specific decision rules (e.g., 'if depression worsens by 5+ points on BDI-II, increase to twice-weekly sessions and consider medication referral; if no improvement by week 4, review case in supervision and consider treatment modifications'), When to discontinue - criteria for stopping (e.g., 'if patient develops active suicidal plan, refer for higher level of care; if patient shows no response after 8 weeks despite good adherence, consider alternative treatment'), and Follow-up planning - how to maintain gains (e.g., 'schedule booster sessions at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment as relapse prevention').

Cover: Study design quality (e.g., 'This recommendation is based on a well-designed randomized controlled trial with 120 participants, representing Moderate to High quality evidence per GRADE criteria. The study used appropriate randomization, had low dropout rates (10%), used validated outcome measures, and had blinded outcome assessment'), Effect size and clinical significance (e.g., 'The large effect size (Cohen's d=1.73) and high statistical significance (p<0.001) indicate robust treatment effects. The mean improvement of 15.2 points on the BDI-II exceeds the minimal clinically important difference of 10 points, suggesting clinically meaningful change'), Precision of estimates (e.g., 'confidence intervals were narrow, indicating precise estimates of treatment effects'), Consistency (e.g., 'findings were consistent across primary and secondary outcomes, with improvements in depression, anxiety, and quality of life'), Directness (e.g., 'study directly examined the intervention and outcomes of interest in the target population'), Limitations that affect evidence quality (e.g., 'evidence quality is tempered by: (1) lack of long-term follow-up data beyond 8 weeks, so durability of effects is unknown; (2) single-site recruitment from urban outpatient clinic limits generalizability to other settings; (3) no assessment of treatment fidelity or therapist effects, so unclear if results depend on specific therapist characteristics'), Applicability to clinical practice (e.g., 'intervention is applicable to adults with major depressive disorder in outpatient settings who are similar to study participants. Extrapolation to other populations (adolescents, elderly, inpatient settings, treatment-resistant depression, different cultural groups) should be done cautiously'), Risk of bias assessment, Publication bias considerations if relevant, and Overall GRADE rating with justification (e.g., 'Overall GRADE rating: Moderate quality evidence supporting Strong recommendation for CBT in MDD. Quality is high enough to be confident in effect estimates, though some uncertainty remains about long-term outcomes and generalizability'). Write in full paragraphs with complete reasoning.

**EXAMPLE OF PROPER DEPTH**:

BAD (too shallow - 200 chars):
"Interventions: Use 8-week CBT program for depression. Include cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation. Deliver weekly sessions."

GOOD (proper depth - 1500+ chars):
"Interventions: Implement a comprehensive 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program specifically designed for adults with major depressive disorder, based on the study protocol which demonstrated large effect sizes (Cohen's d=1.73, p<0.001). The intervention should be delivered as individual therapy sessions, 50 minutes in duration, conducted weekly for 8 consecutive weeks in an outpatient setting. Each session should be delivered by a licensed clinical psychologist or licensed clinical social worker with specialized training in CBT, ideally with at least 5 years of clinical experience and specific training in treating depression. The core components of the intervention, which must all be included to replicate the study's success, are: (1) Psychoeducation about depression and the cognitive-behavioral model, helping patients understand the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how depression maintains itself through negative thinking patterns and behavioral withdrawal; (2) Cognitive restructuring techniques, teaching patients to identify negative automatic thoughts, evaluate the evidence for and against these thoughts, and develop more balanced alternative perspectives, using structured thought records and Socratic questioning; (3) Behavioral activation, systematically increasing engagement in pleasant and meaningful activities to counter the withdrawal and inactivity that maintains depression, using activity scheduling and monitoring; (4) Core belief work in later sessions, identifying and modifying deeper maladaptive schemas that underlie depressive thinking; and (5) Relapse prevention planning, helping patients consolidate skills and develop strategies to maintain gains and prevent future episodes. The study demonstrated that this intervention produces clinically significant improvements not only in depression (mean BDI-II reduction of 15.2 points, well above the 10-point threshold for clinical significance), but also in associated symptoms of anxiety (p=0.003) and quality of life (p=0.01), suggesting broad therapeutic benefits. The intervention works through multiple mechanisms: cognitive restructuring reduces negative thinking patterns that maintain depression, behavioral activation increases positive reinforcement and counters withdrawal, and the therapeutic relationship provides support and accountability. Patients should be informed that improvement is typically gradual across the 8 weeks, with some experiencing early gains and others improving more steadily, and that active engagement including completion of between-session homework assignments is associated with better outcomes."
