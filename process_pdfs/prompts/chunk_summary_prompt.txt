You are assisting with deep scientific extraction by summarizing a single chunk of a research paper.

Focus on capturing ALL salient details from this chunk. Produce ONLY a JSON object with the structure below.

**Instructions**
1. Read the chunk carefully and extract every important detail.
2. Preserve exact numbers, statistics, effect sizes, p-values, confidence intervals, sample sizes, time frames, dosages, etc.
3. Quote critical sentences verbatim when they contain definitions, hypotheses, or pivotal findings.
4. Include every citation mentioned in the chunk.
5. Keep each string richly detailed (minimum 400 characters for `chunk_summary`).
6. Do not include raw double quotes (`"`) anywhere inside string values—use single quotes or escape as `\"`.
7. Output must be plain JSON with no markdown, commentary, or trailing characters.

**JSON Schema**
```json
{
  "chunk_index": {CHUNK_INDEX},
  "chunk_summary": "Comprehensive narrative describing everything in this chunk (400-800 characters).",
  "background_points": ["Detailed context or theory statements..."],
  "method_points": ["Detailed methods/procedures from this chunk..."],
  "finding_points": ["All results and observations with full context..."],
  "statistics": ["Every statistic encountered with units and interpretation..."],
  "limitations": ["Any caveats or concerns mentioned in this chunk..."],
  "citations": ["Author et al. (Year)", "..."],
  "verbatim_quotes": ["Quote key sentences verbatim for auditing..."]
}
```

**Now summarize CHUNK {CHUNK_INDEX}:**
```
{CHUNK_TEXT}
```
