[Enlitens: A Rebellious, Neurodiversity‑Affirming Approach to Mental Health



Enlitens is a mental health practice built as an evidence-based rebellion against the traditional, pathologizing model of mental health care

enlitens.com

. Founded by Liz Wooten, LPC (the “Rebellious Academic” herself), Enlitens stands for a radical commitment to affirming, not “fixing,” the human mind

enlitens.com

. In their eyes, the mental health system isn’t failing because clients are “disordered” – it’s failing because the system is broken, not the people it was supposed to help

enlitens.com

. Below is a comprehensive guide to Enlitens’ philosophy, clinical model, and how it diverges from mainstream approaches, all in the bold, authentic tone found throughout their work.



Philosophy: A Rebellion Against a Broken System



Burning the Map: Enlitens bluntly asserts that “the traditional mental health model is a relic built on a flawed and pathologizing map. We are here to burn that map.”

enlitens.com

 Their core philosophy is a rigorous, science-backed stance grounded in modern neuroscience and compassion. Rather than accepting the old “medical model” of mental health, which treats emotional struggles as signs of a broken or diseased brain, Enlitens calls out that model as outdated and harmful. In their words, “Clinging to the pathology paradigm in 2025 is the most unscientific position one can take, because it requires ignoring the last 50 years of neuroscience.” They insist their approach “is not a rejection of science; it is an embrace of better, more current science.”

 In short, Enlitens isn’t anti-science at all – it’s anti-bad science and stagnant thinking.



The Pathology Paradigm vs. the Truth: The team explicitly deconstructs what they call “the foundational lie of modern mental health” – the pathology paradigm

enlitens.com

. This paradigm assumes that if you are anxious, depressed, distracted, or overwhelmed, then your brain must be broken or disordered

enlitens.com

. Enlitens explains that this 19th-century idea was born from ignorance: it made sense over a hundred years ago to search for “diseases” of the mind, but today it’s flat-out wrong and destructive

enlitens.com

. Why? Because it ignores context – “It Ignores Fucking Context.” as they put it bluntly

enlitens.com

. Human suffering cannot be fully understood by a checklist of symptoms voted into existence by a committee (Enlitens points out that the DSM, psychiatry’s “bible,” has “no objective biomarkers” and is essentially a book of subjective checklists

enlitens.com

). The pathology model writes off context – trauma, environment, societal pressures – and labels the person as defective. Enlitens finds that scientifically bankrupt and ethically unacceptable.



The Neurodiversity-Affirming Paradigm: As an alternative, Enlitens has thrown out that pathology lens and replaced it with a neurodiversity-affirming, systems-based paradigm

enlitens.com

. Their mantra: “Stop diagnosing the fish. Start analyzing the water.”

enlitens.com

. In a vivid analogy, they explain that traditional therapy taught you to see yourself as a sick fish, when in reality “you are a perfectly healthy fish who has been forced to swim in toxic water.” The Enlitens model “is designed to stop analyzing the fish and start analyzing the water.”

enlitens.com

enlitens.com

 In practical terms, this means they view emotional and neurodevelopmental challenges not as internal defects, but as mismatches between the person and their environment

enlitens.com

. Context is everything.



Under this approach, your distress is reframed entirely: “In our model, your distress is not a ‘symptom’ of a ‘disorder.’ Your distress is an intelligent, adaptive response to a dysfunctional or mismatched environment.”

enlitens.com

enlitens.com

 Rather than blaming your brain, Enlitens looks at why your circumstances might be provoking that response and how it actually makes sense given the context. For example:



Anxiety isn’t a malfunctioning “broken fear circuit” at all; it may be “a perfectly functioning threat-detection system screaming that you are in an unsafe situation.”

enlitens.com

 In other words, your anxiety is telling us something real about your environment or past experiences – “your anxiety is data,” not proof of a defective brain

enlitens.com

. The goal isn’t to “cure” or silence this alarm (your brain isn’t “broken”); the goal is to recalibrate it and address why it’s on high alert

enlitens.com

.



“Executive dysfunction” (trouble with focus, organization, motivation) is not a character flaw or laziness. Enlitens flatly calls it “a predictable outcome of a dopamine-interest system being forced to operate on boring-as-hell fuel.”

enlitens.com

 In plain terms, if a neurodivergent person’s brain chemistry needs interest and stimulation to get motivated, forcing them into dull, inflexible tasks will obviously lead to shutdowns. The problem isn’t the person; it’s the mismatch between their natural operating system and the demands placed on it.



The pattern here is clear: the problem is not in you; the problem is in the friction between you and your world

enlitens.com

. And that’s a problem that can actually be solved – by changing the environment, finding accommodations, and helping you understand your own mind, rather than trying to “fix” you to fit a broken mold.



Anti-Pathology, Not Anti-Diagnosis: It’s important to note that Enlitens does not reject diagnosis outright – they reject the way diagnoses are often used. They are, in their words, “relentlessly anti-pathology,” but “not ‘anti-diagnosis’”

enlitens.com

. A clinical label can be profoundly validating and helpful as a tool for self-understanding or accessing support. The problem is not the label itself; “it’s the bullshit that comes attached to it—the implicit message that you have a ‘disorder.’”*

enlitens.com

 Enlitens strives to separate the useful label from the harmful lie

enlitens.com

. In practice, that means if you or your child are assessed and labeled with something like Autism or ADHD, Enlitens will treat that label as a neutral description or a “user manual” entry for how your brain works, not as a value judgment or life sentence of pathology. They refuse to use the word “disorder” to define clients; you’ll hear terms like “neurotype” or “unique operating system” instead.



What “Affirming Care” Really Means: At Enlitens, simply being a kind, empathetic therapist isn’t enough – “Empathy is the cost of admission.” True neurodiversity-affirming care is a “rigorous, post-graduate level of clinical practice”

enlitens.com

. Therapists must actively educate themselves in the science and lived experience of neurodivergent people. Enlitens clinicians continually practice “de-colonizing your own mind”

enlitens.com

 – examining and unlearning their own biases about what is “normal.” Affirming care requires deep knowledge of concepts like the Double Empathy Problem, Polyvagal Theory, and the immense cognitive burden of masking (suppressing one’s authentic self to fit in)

enlitens.com

. Enlitens explicitly trains and expects its therapists to understand these theories:



The Double Empathy Problem teaches that social misunderstandings between autistic and non-autistic people are mutual – a two-way translation issue, not a one-sided “social skills deficit.” (In fact, Enlitens highlights research by Dr. Catherine Crompton proving that autistic people communicate just as effectively with each other as non-autistic people do with each other, which underscores that the breakdown happens only across neurotypes

enlitens.com

enlitens.com

.) This concept is central to Enlitens’ approach: they don’t view autistic clients as lacking empathy or skills – instead, therapy focuses on bridging the gap and validating the client’s native communication style.



Polyvagal Theory informs their understanding of trauma and anxiety, emphasizing the role of the autonomic nervous system. It underpins Enlitens’ focus on bodily signals and safety – recognizing when a client is in fight/flight or shutdown and using strategies to help regulate the nervous system rather than just talk about thoughts. This is part of being trauma-informed, a non-negotiable aspect of their work.



Masking is acknowledged as exhausting. Enlitens knows that many neurodivergent folks spend years camouflaging their traits to survive school, work, or social settings – often at great cost to their mental health. Therefore, therapy explicitly validates how crushing the cognitive load of masking can be

enlitens.com

 and works toward environments where masking isn’t necessary for acceptance.



In summary, Enlitens’ philosophy overturns the old “medical model” by integrating 50+ years of neuroscience, honoring context and culture, and fiercely prioritizing the client’s humanity over any label

enlitens.com

. They view neurodiversity as a fact of life and even an asset, not as a problem to be cured. This philosophy forms the foundation for everything else – the “why” that drives their unique clinical methods.



The Enlitens Clinical Model: A Human-First Assessment & Therapy Method



Having a bold philosophy is one thing, but Enlitens also provides a concrete method – the “how” – to put these ideals into practice. As they say, “A philosophy and a science are meaningless without a method.” Their clinical model is “a rigorous, repeatable, and teachable system for facilitating insight and creating change,” designed to “deconstruct the old model and build a new, more humane one.”

enlitens.com



At its core, the Enlitens method is a form of collaborative, neurobiologically-grounded psychological assessment intertwined with therapy. It’s often referred to as the Enlitens Interview or Therapeutic Assessment process. Rather than the clinician “diagnosing” from on high, clinician and client work as partners in a deep investigation of the client’s mind. Enlitens describes it as finally getting a “user manual for your own brain.” This process is not a passive exam – it’s actually the first act of therapy. In fact, they explicitly state, “The assessment is not a test; it is the first act of therapy.”

enlitens.com

 From the very first session, healing and self-discovery are underway.



Key Components of the Enlitens Method (“The Engine of Our Practice”): Enlitens has developed several innovative tools and practices as part of their assessment framework. Each is geared toward illuminating the client’s unique neurocognitive profile in a respectful, non-pathologizing way. Major components include:



Brown EF/A Scales as a Flashlight: Instead of using executive function questionnaires as a simplistic “pass/fail” test of attention or memory, Enlitens uses the Brown Executive Function/Attention Scales as “a flashlight.” They explain, “We use this tool not as a test, but as a flashlight” – a way to shine light on the specific situations where things break down

enlitens.com

. The Brown EF/A is a nuanced, real-world measure of executive functioning, and Enlitens mines it for insights into “points of friction in a person’s daily life.”

enlitens.com

 In practice, this might reveal, for example, that a client’s biggest struggles are with task initiation in the morning or with shifting focus under pressure. Those insights then guide intervention (rather than simply generating a score and judging the client against a norm).



Sensory Profile Mapping: Many neurodivergent and trauma-affected individuals have unique sensory processing patterns – things like sensitivity to noise, touch, lights, or an under-responsiveness to certain stimuli. Enlitens takes the Sensory Profile (a standardized tool) and uses it to map each person’s unique sensory landscape. This mapping is “the first step in deconstructing meltdowns, shutdowns, and burnout by honoring the body’s reality.”

enlitens.com

 In other words, by understanding exactly how a client’s body reacts to the environment (what overwhelms their senses or what input they crave), Enlitens can help craft sensory accommodations and self-regulation strategies. It’s a way of listening to the body before pathologizing behaviors. If a teenager is prone to explosive outbursts every day after school, a sensory profile might reveal it’s not “random irritability” – it could be cumulative sensory overload from fluorescent lights, loud hallways, and touch (like uncomfortable clothing) all day long. Rather than labeling the teen “oppositional,” the solution might involve sensory adjustments (dimming lights, noise-cancelling headphones, a compression vest, etc.) to prevent that overload. By honoring the body’s reality, Enlitens helps clients manage stress in a compassionate way.



Tiered Narrative Inquiry: This is Enlitens’ signature interviewing technique. It’s an approach to the clinical interview that prioritizes story over checklists. The clinician begins with “a single, open-ended question” and then follows the client’s narrative threads wherever they lead

enlitens.com

. This method allows the “deep, authentic story of a person’s life” to unfold, rather than a superficial list of symptoms

enlitens.com

. Enlitens calls it “the art of collaborative investigation.”

enlitens.com

 Practically, this might look like starting an intake session by asking, “Tell me about yourself – what brings you here?” and truly letting the client take it in the directions most salient to them. The clinician actively listens for patterns and significant moments in the story (traumas, successes, coping strategies, interests, relationships) and gently probes deeper (“tiered” questioning) to uncover meaningful insights. This stands in stark contrast to the rapid-fire Q&A many standard assessments use. Tiered Narrative Inquiry treats the client as the expert of their own life, and the clinician as a curious partner helping connect dots. It’s through their personal narrative that hypotheses form – not through a generic checkbox form.



The Cognitive Walk-Through: Enlitens recognizes that insight without action isn’t enough. They place heavy emphasis on translating understanding into real-world changes. As they succinctly put it, “Insight is one thing; action is another.”

enlitens.com

 The Cognitive Walk-Through is their process for bridging the “why” to the “how.” After gathering insights from the interview and assessment, client and clinician co-design practical accommodations and strategies to address daily challenges

enlitens.com

. It’s like taking a mental “walk” through the client’s typical day or a specific problematic scenario, armed with new understanding, and collaboratively brainstorming adjustments. For example, if the assessment illuminated that a client’s “time blindness” (common in ADHD) causes them to miss appointments, the walk-through might involve experimenting with visual timers, calendar routines, or a humorous accountability partner – whatever fits the client’s style – rather than just scolding them to “try harder.” The key is that these solutions are co-created and tailored; they actually work for the client because the client helped design them. This is where therapy becomes very active and customized, not just talking about problems but systematically engineering solutions with the client in the driver’s seat.



Therapeutic Assessment (Collaboration as Healing): Perhaps the most radical aspect of the Enlitens model is the idea that the assessment itself is therapeutic. They explicitly state, “the assessment is not a test; it is the first act of therapy.”

enlitens.com

 The entire process is done with the client (and family, if applicable), in a compassionate and transparent way, such that going through it actually reduces shame and sparks hope. Enlitens believes a **“collaborative, compassionate, and transparent assessment process can be profoundly healing in and of itself.”*

enlitens.com

 What does this look like in practice? It means no mysterious scores or one-way mirror observations where the client is left in the dark. Instead, clients are informed and involved at every step: the clinician explains the purpose of each exercise, invites the client’s own perceptions of how they approach tasks, and shares findings as partners. By the end, instead of handing the client a sterile report full of technical jargon, the clinician gives them a “user manual” style report – written in plain, validating language – that they helped create. Enlitens even has a guide on making the assessment report a user-friendly “owner’s manual” for the brain, emphasizing practical understanding over clinical gobbledygook. The outcome of a Therapeutic Assessment is that the client feels seen, affirmed, and empowered with knowledge about how their mind works, rather than feeling judged or “diagnosed.” Many clients describe this process as a huge relief – finally, an explanation that makes sense without making them feel broken. It often leads to therapeutic momentum: armed with their “owner’s manual,” clients are eager to try new strategies and advocate for their needs (for instance, using their report to explain those needs at work or school).



All these components together form the Enlitens Interview or assessment framework. Typically, a full Enlitens assessment unfolds over two to three sessions (similar in length to a standard psych eval)

enlitens.com

. However, it’s designed in modules, so it’s incredibly flexible. A clinician can pull out just one piece – say, a Social Debrief (more on that shortly) or a Cognitive Walk-Through – and use it as a standalone intervention in regular therapy

enlitens.com

. In fact, Enlitens-trained therapists often weave these tools into ongoing counseling. The modular design means the approach can be tailored to each client’s needs and time frame, rather than a one-size-fits-all battery of tests.



Beyond Neurodivergence – A Human-Affirming Model for All: While Enlitens explicitly centers neurodivergent individuals (e.g. autistic, ADHD, dyslexic, etc.) – especially those who “have been failed by the traditional system” – they stress that their core principles are “universally human.”

enlitens.com

 This model works for anyone who feels misunderstood, anyone with complex trauma, or frankly “anyone who is simply tired of the pathologizing bullshit of the mainstream mental health world.”*

enlitens.com

 It’s “a human-affirming model, period.”

enlitens.com

 In other words, you don’t need a specific diagnosis to benefit from this approach; it’s about meeting individual human beings where they are. Because it’s trauma-informed, strengths-based, and grounded in neurobiology, the model adapts to you, rather than forcing you to adapt to the model. Enlitens has found that neurotypical clients and those with complicated histories respond just as positively to this collaborative, respectful style as neurodivergent clients do. The common denominator is that most people are relieved to finally be treated as whole humans in context, rather than a collection of disorders.



Furthermore, Enlitens does not aim to create lifelong clients who depend on therapy forever. A striking element of their philosophy is the belief that therapy should be a time-limited intervention – “not a life sentence” but “a temporary workshop to give you the tools you need to launch.” Their goal is the client’s independence, not indefinite therapy maintenance. This ethos of empowering clients to eventually not need them is part of what makes their approach feel so refreshingly client-centered. Progress is not expected to be a straight line, and setbacks are normalized (they even write about how “therapy progress isn’t linear” – preparing clients for ups and downs). But always, the north star is helping clients build the insight, skills, and self-advocacy to navigate life on their own terms.



Rejecting “Gold Standards” and Harmful Practices



Enlitens’ rebellious stance means they don’t hesitate to throw out even the most venerated tools or practices in the field if they believe those tools are hurting more than helping. Two major examples stand out: their refusal to use the ADOS-2 autism test, and their condemnation of ABA therapy and rote “social skills training.”



Why They Don’t Use the ADOS-2: The ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) is often touted in mainstream psychology as the “gold standard” for autism assessment. Enlitens pointedly calls it the “so-called ‘gold standard’”

enlitens.com

 – with emphasis on “so-called.” On their site, they flatly declare: “The so-called ‘gold standard’ for autism assessment is a flawed and often traumatizing tool. [Here is] our evidence-based argument for why we have thrown it in the trash in favor of a more humane and accurate approach.”

enlitens.com

 In other words, Enlitens has literally ditched the ADOS from their practice. Why? They detail multiple reasons in their writings. The ADOS can yield false positives (labeling people autistic who aren’t) and false negatives (missing those who are, especially in girls or adults who mask). It often puts clients – especially children – through stressful, contrived social scenarios that can feel confusing or even humiliating, all for a dubious “score.” Enlitens refers to the ADOS as flawed, outdated, and traumatizing

enlitens.com

. Instead of leaning on this one-size-fits-all instrument, Enlitens favors the kinder, context-rich assessment model we described earlier (narrative interviewing, real-world measures like the Brown Scale, sensory profiling, etc.). They argue this yields a more accurate understanding of an individual’s neurotype and spares them the trauma of being put under a microscope. It’s worth noting that Enlitens backs up this stance with research: one of their “Science Hub” articles highlights a study on the ADOS-2’s high false-positive rate

enlitens.com

, underscoring that even “gold standards” aren’t infallible. By dropping the ADOS, Enlitens aligns their assessment with their values – prioritizing the client’s experience and truth over adherence to tradition.



Burning Down the ABA Empire: If there’s one thing Enlitens is even more passionate about than scrapping the ADOS, it’s their opposition to Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) as a treatment for autism. ABA is widely used (and controversially so) to train autistic children to perform neurotypical behaviors through repetition and rewards. Enlitens does not mince words here. They identify a certain pervasive “lie” in autism treatment – the lie that there is one “correct” way to be social (the neurotypical way) and that autistic people must be trained to mimic it

enlitens.com

. They then state, “This is the lie that has fueled the multi-billion dollar ABA industry… the source of immeasurable shame and trauma for millions. It is an intellectually lazy, scientifically bankrupt, and ethically abhorrent framework. And we are here to burn it to the ground with the truth.”

enlitens.com

. That is about as strong a rebuke as one can imagine. Enlitens’ rationale is that ABA, and traditional “social skills training” programs, are built on fundamentally ableist assumptions – namely, that the autistic person is inherently wrong in their natural social expressions and must be molded to appear “normal.” This approach not only invalidates the person’s identity, but can cause lasting trauma (many autistic adults who underwent intensive ABA report PTSD-like symptoms from being forced to hide their true selves as children). Enlitens stands firmly against any method that treats the neurodivergent person as the sole problem. Instead, they embrace the Double Empathy framework: social success is a two-way street, and misunderstandings are as much due to neurotypical rigidity or lack of adaptation as anything.



The “Social Debrief” Alternative: As an answer to cookie-cutter social skills groups, Enlitens developed what they call the Social Debrief – “a revolutionary method that treats a social event like a mission to be analyzed.” Instead of drilling eye contact and small talk scripts, Enlitens will take a real social experience (say, a lunchroom incident or a failed date) and deconstruct it with the client after the fact: What happened? What signals might have been missed on both sides? How did it feel for you? What might a neurotypical person have been thinking? Crucially, this is done without judgment – the goal isn’t to label the client’s behavior as wrong, but to increase mutual understanding. The Social Debrief aligns with what Enlitens writes in their Double Empathy guide: “We believe in building the skills of effective communication, which include authentic self-expression, advocating for your needs, and learning to be a ‘translator’ between different communication styles, not just performing a part in a play you were never given the script for.”

enlitens.com

 This means an autistic teen working with Enlitens won’t be told “look me in the eyes to show respect.” Instead, they might learn to say to their parent or teacher, “I listen better when I’m not forced into eye contact – here’s what works for me.” Likewise, Enlitens might coach the parent/teacher to recognize that lack of eye contact isn’t defiance at all, but a strategy the teen uses to focus. Both sides learn and adapt. By validating the client’s native social style and also giving them tools to navigate the neurotypical world (as a translator, not an actor), Enlitens aims to end the shame and self-alienation that old-school social skills training often breeds.



In the bigger picture, Enlitens rejects any intervention that is rooted in forcing normalcy or assuming the client is “the problem.” Beyond ABA, this philosophy extends to calling out things like:



Pseudo-scientific fads and “quick fixes”: They caution against unlicensed “coaches” who promise to cure ADHD or autism with dubious methods (one Enlitens article exposes “predatory coaching” practices). They emphasize that while coaching strategies (like for executive function) can be helpful, they should be grounded in evidence and delivered ethically – preferably by professionals who understand mental health complexity. Enlitens itself blends coaching into therapy for skills like organization or life planning, but always under the umbrella of licensed, personalized care.



Therapist red flags: Enlitens encourages clients to vet therapists and trust their gut. They even have a “Finding the Right Therapist: Our Fit Manifesto” and guides on spotting a bad therapist fit or surviving a “bad therapy” experience. This is unusual for a therapy practice to admit, but Enlitens openly acknowledges that not every therapist (or therapy model) is right for every client – and that some are downright harmful. They’d rather a client leave and find a better fit than stay and be further harmed. This honesty is part of their client-first ethics.



The “Medication-Only” mindset: While Enlitens is not anti-medication (they recognize meds like SSRIs or stimulants can be hugely helpful tools), they resent the simplistic “chemical imbalance” narrative that implies pills alone will “fix” a person. On their site they note that the “chemical imbalance theory” of depression was a wildly successful marketing slogan – but it’s been debunked by research

enlitens.com

. Medication, in their view, works by increasing neuroplasticity or calming an over-stressed nervous system – basically, creating a window of stability for deeper therapy work, not magically correcting a fictional brain flaw

enlitens.com

. They do often recommend clients consider meds as one tool in the toolbox (especially if someone’s anxiety or insomnia is so bad that therapy can’t even get started). But they frame meds as empowering supports, not as cures, and they work on lifestyle, mindset, and environmental changes in parallel. Enlitens also stays abreast of cutting-edge neuroscience treatments – for instance, they discuss things like neurofeedback, TMS, or the impact of mindfulness on brain networks – but always with a balanced, research-informed perspective (no hype, and certainly no pressure if a client isn’t interested).



In sum, Enlitens is willing to defy industry “standards” whenever those standards conflict with what current science and basic humanity tell us. They refuse to use tests or therapies that make clients feel like broken objects. Every tool in the Enlitens toolbox must pass a simple litmus test: Does it help the client understand themselves better and improve their life? If not, it’s out. This is why they’ve earned a reputation for being “rebellious academic” – they challenge norms with scholarly evidence in one hand and genuine compassion in the other.



Grounded in Science and Continuous Learning



Despite the irreverent tone (yes, you’ll see the occasional “bulls*it” or “Hell no” in their writing), Enlitens backs up its claims with an impressive array of peer-reviewed research and emerging scientific insights. They are self-proclaimed nerds about the brain and behavior – just nerds with a cause. Their website features a “Science Hub” where they translate new research findings into accessible language and show how it supports a neurodiversity-affirming approach. Some examples of science topics they highlight include:



Neuroplasticity and Trauma: They discuss studies on how trauma can rewire the brain and even influence gene expression (epigenetics). Rather than using this to paint a bleak picture, Enlitens emphasizes the flip side – neuroplasticity also means the brain can heal and change. In a post about trauma and brain changes, they convey hope that with the right support, one can “remodel” the impact of past trauma (capitalizing on the same brain plasticity that caused those changes in the first place).



The “Myth of the Average Brain”: Enlitens loves research that debunks the idea of any single “normal” brain. They cite cutting-edge studies (including work by a Washington University team) showing huge variability in brain structure and function across individuals

enlitens.com

. This science bolsters the neurodiversity concept that there isn’t one gold-standard brain we should all aspire to have. It lends scientific credence to their rejection of phrases like “normal brain” or “disordered brain.”



Default Mode Network (DMN) and Brain Connectivity: In contrast to the DSM’s symptom lists, Enlitens points out that modern neuroscience is looking at brain networks (like the Default Mode Network, which is involved in internal thought and self-referential processing) to understand conditions like ADHD, autism, and depression

enlitens.com

. They argue that this network-based, brain-and-body approach is the real scientific frontier, not the outdated medical-model notion that a mental disorder is like catching a germ or having a simple chemical imbalance.



Autistic Communication Research: As mentioned, they highlight studies by researchers like Dr. Damian Milton (who proposed the Double Empathy Problem) and Dr. Catherine Crompton (whose experiments demonstrated that communication breakdowns happen between mixed groups, not within autistic-only groups). By sharing this evidence, Enlitens not only validates their clients’ lived experiences (“See, it’s science – you’re not broken!”) but also arms themselves with facts to challenge skeptics of the neurodiversity approach.



Masking and Mental Health: They reference research on how masking (suppressing one’s autistic or ADHD traits) leads to burnout and mental health struggles. They use such findings to advocate for change in schools and workplaces: rather than forcing neurodivergent individuals to mask until they collapse, society should allow authentic expression and provide accommodations. Enlitens takes these papers and turns them into guides for clients (e.g. “Neurodivergent Masking & Unmasking – A Guide”) to help them navigate when to mask for safety and when to shed the mask for wellbeing.



RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) and Emotional Regulation: They talk about concepts like RSD – the intense sensitivity to perceived rejection common in ADHD – and tie them to neuroscience of emotional regulation. This helps clients name and normalize very painful experiences (instead of feeling “oversensitive” or “crazy”). It’s another example of blending academic knowledge with empathetic care.



The takeaway is that Enlitens stays up-to-date and intentionally open-source with knowledge. They actually share their sources and even openly license their content (the website notes everything is © 2025 Enlitens, LLC but released under a Creative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license

enlitens.com

). This reflects their Open Source Philosophy: they believe mental health knowledge shouldn’t be hoarded or hidden behind paywalls. They publish their insights and even their entire model online for others to learn. In fact, they invite other clinicians to join the “rebellion” – the site’s Community Support Hub reaches out to like-minded professionals, and their “For Therapists” section is essentially a manifesto and toolkit for practitioners who want to deliver neurodiversity-affirming care instead of pathologizing therapy. Enlitens recognizes that to truly change the system, it’s not enough to help individual clients; they want to influence the field at large by freely sharing what works.



A Commitment to Transparency and Social Justice



Enlitens doesn’t just preach values – they embed them in how they run the practice. Their philosophy of affirming human dignity and rejecting “the way it’s always been done” extends to practical matters like fees, policies, and accessibility:



Radical Transparency in Costs & Policies: They openly discuss the often confusing or predatory practices in mental health (like surprise billing, insurance loopholes, long waitlists, rigid cancellation policies) and how those harm people. In contrast, Enlitens prides itself on clear, upfront policies and an ethos of fairness. One guide on their site, for example, explains exactly how to use a “superbill” for insurance reimbursement – empowering clients with knowledge to navigate insurance if Enlitens is out-of-network. They also have a refreshingly understanding stance on things like lateness or forgetfulness. As a neurodivergent-affirming practice, they explicitly state that lateness or missed appointments will not be shamed; instead they plan for these possibilities (because time-blindness and memory glitches are part of ADHD/Autism) with reasonable flexibility

xd.enlitens.com

. Their “Time Blindness policy” basically says: we get it, being late isn’t a moral failure, let’s work with it constructively

xd.enlitens.com

. This is part of being affirming – adapting their business rules to neurodivergent needs, not punishing the client.



Sliding Scale and Accessibility: Enlitens is upfront that their mission is not to maximize profit. “Our philosophy is built on social justice and accessibility, not on maximizing profit. Our rebellion is in our business model itself,” one page declares

enlitens.com

. They offer sliding scale fees and even free initial consultations (“Fit Checks”) to lower the bar of entry. If a family can’t afford a full assessment, Enlitens will do their best to find a creative solution – because they genuinely care more about people getting help than about squeezing every dollar. By contrast, they critique how many practices or coaching programs charge exorbitant fees for “miracle cures” that don’t deliver. Enlitens strives to be ethically priced and client-centered in all financial matters. They even provide guidance on “How to pay for therapy” with resources on HSAs, out-of-network benefits, etc., to reduce financial stress for clients.



No Gatekeeping or Elitism: The open-source Creative Commons license on their content is a tangible sign that Enlitens wants the information out there. Families and professionals alike can read their entire approach free of charge on the website. This transparency is rare; many clinics keep their “secret sauce” proprietary. Enlitens, however, operates with a collaborative spirit – if something they do can help others, they put it into the world. In therapy, they likewise don’t hoard power or knowledge over the client; they share test results, teach the client the science of their own condition, and even admit when the client might know more about their experience than the “expert” does. It’s a partnership, not a hierarchy.



In concluding, Enlitens represents a new model for mental health care – one that is fiercely compassionate, unflinchingly honest about the field’s shortcomings, and anchored in up-to-the-minute science as well as real human experience. They are “rebellious” in the best way: willing to call B.S. on methods that don’t work, even if that ruffles feathers, and willing to stand up for clients who have been misunderstood or mistreated by the system. Yet they are also academic and evidence-driven, ensuring that their “revolution” isn’t just loud rhetoric but is backed by legitimate research and methodology.



For anyone who has felt alienated by diagnoses that read like personal condemnations, or for any clinician who has sensed “there has to be a better way” – Enlitens offers an inspiring blueprint. It says: You’re not broken. The map we were using was wrong. With humility and humor (and yes, some curse words for emphasis), Enlitens is drawing a new map – one where mental health care is about understanding your unique brain, celebrating neurodiversity, and helping you thrive in a world that finally adjusts to you, not the other way around.
