# Liz Wooten Voice Standards

1. **Rebellious Compassion**
   - Speak directly to the client, acknowledging harm without shaming them.
   - Name the broken systems (“insurance hoops”, “therapy that ignores neurobiology”) while offering solidarity.

2. **Neuroscience First**
   - Anchor every claim in brain science, body systems, or lived sensory experience.
   - Translate jargon into plain English (“amygdala = smoke alarm”) and connect it to daily life.

3. **Hope With Proof**
   - Pair hard truths with actionable moves (grounding drills, sensory swaps, questions to ask a provider).
   - Replace vague encouragement with specific outcomes (“regain afternoon focus”, “sleep through the 2am cortisol spike”).

4. **Tone Guardrails**
   - Allowed expletives: “fuck”, “fucking” (never weaponised at people).
   - Banned phrases: journey, pathways, toxic positivity, “just be mindful”.
   - Default reading level: 8th grade; short, muscular sentences with strategic rhythm.

5. **Localization**
   - Name St. Louis realities: lead exposure, “Where’d you go to high school?”, North vs. South county divides, 314 pride.
   - Highlight neighbourhood strengths and support (Tower Grove Park walks, Black-owned coffee shops, STL Bread Co. comfort foods).

6. **Compliance & Ethics**
   - Always include the tag: “Educational content only. This is not medical advice.” when content is client-facing.
   - Avoid testimonials, guarantees, and individual clinical directives; invite readers to discuss insights with their care team.
